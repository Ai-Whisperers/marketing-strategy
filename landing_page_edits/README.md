## Common Questions

### "Do I need to implement everything?"
No. Start with Week 1 priorities (hero, GitHub section, lead capture). That's 80% of the impact.

### "Can I change the copy?"
Yes! This is your starting point. Adapt to your voice, but keep the structure and strategy.

### "What if I don't have a team section ready?"
Skip it for now. Focus on hero, positioning, and lead capture first.

### "How technical is the WhatsApp integration?"
Depends on your choice:
- Simple widget: Easy (30 min)
- WhatsApp Business app: Medium (2-4 hours)
- Full API integration: Complex (8-16 hours)

### "Should I hire help?"
For basic content updates: No, you can do it.
For WhatsApp API integration: Consider it if not technical.
For design polish: Nice to have, but not critical.
