# Project Description & Requirements: AI Whisperers Marketing Hub

## 1. Project Description

**Project Name:** AI Whisperers Marketing Hub
**Type:** Agency Operating System (AI-Powered)
**Goal:** To build a scalable, automated marketing infrastructure that positions "AI Whisperers" as the premier AI automation consultancy in Paraguay and Latin America.

**Overview:**
This project involves the creation and maintenance of a central "Marketing Hub" that serves as the brain for the agency. Unlike traditional agencies that rely heavily on manual labor, this project leverages **AI Agents** (via the MCP protocol) to automate research, content generation, and sales outreach. The system is designed to "eat its own dog food"—using the very AI tools we sell to clients to grow our own business.

**Core Philosophy:** "Practitioners who build in public." We demonstrate our expertise not just by talking about AI, but by showing how we use it to run our own operations.

## 2. Project Requirements

### A. Infrastructure & Organization
*   **Centralized Hub**: A structured directory (`AI-Whisperers-Marketing-Hub`) must exist to house all marketing assets, separated by function (Strategy, Audience, Content, Sales, Analytics).
*   **Version Control**: All assets must be version-controlled via Git to track changes, experiments, and campaign iterations.
*   **Agent-Human Protocol**: Clear separation of duties between "Agent Tasks" (execution, data) and "Human Tasks" (strategy, relationships), defined in `agent-tasks.md` and `human-tasks.md`.

### B. Target Audience & Intelligence
*   **ICP Definition**: Clearly defined Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) for key verticals:
    *   *Hospitality* (Hotels needing reputation management).
    *   *Utilities* (Energy/Water companies facing public backlash).
    *   *Enterprise* (Airlines, Telecoms, Banks with high volume support).
*   **Brand Briefs**: Mandatory deep-dive research documents for every Tier 1 prospect (e.g., ANDE, LATAM, Tigo) before any outreach occurs.
*   **Pain Point Mapping**: Each prospect must be mapped to a specific "AI Solution" (e.g., Comment Analyzer, Chatbot, Internal Training).

### C. Content & Messaging Engine
*   **"Build in Public" Content**: Regular LinkedIn posts and case studies that showcase our technical capabilities (e.g., "How we scraped 10k comments to help X company").
*   **Hyper-Personalized Outreach**: Cold email sequences must be 100% tailored to the recipient's recent news or specific pain points (no generic spam).
*   **Multi-Language Support**: All assets must be available in **Spanish** (primary market) and English (tech context).

### D. Technical Capabilities (MCP Integration)
*   **Web Scraping**: Ability to autonomously scrape prospect websites and social media for "hooks" and data.
*   **File Management**: Agents must be able to read, write, and organize files within the Hub autonomously.
*   **Git Integration**: Agents must be able to commit their own work to the repository.

### E. Success Metrics (KPIs)
*   **Outreach Volume**: 5-10 high-quality, researched contacts per week.
*   **Response Rate**: Target >15% on cold outreach (achieved via hyper-personalization).
*   **Asset Creation**: 1 new "Brand Brief" and "Campaign Kit" per major prospect.
