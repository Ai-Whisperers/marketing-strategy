## Decision-Making Unit

For solopreneurs, the DMU is typically just them, but consider:

| Role | Who | What They Care About |
|------|-----|---------------------|
| Economic Buyer | Themselves | ROI, affordability |
| Technical Evaluator | Themselves (or tech-savvy friend) | "Will this actually work?" |
| User | Themselves | Ease of use, time savings |
| Influencer | Spouse/Partner | Family time, stress reduction |
| Coach/Mentor | Business advisor | Growth, scalability |

**Key Insight**: Spouses/partners often have significant influence. "Getting time back" resonates because it means time with family, not just more work capacity.
