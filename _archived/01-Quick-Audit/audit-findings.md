## Competitive Positioning

### Your Unique Angle (Based on What I See):

**"Practitioners, Not Just Consultants"**

You're not just talking about automation—you're building it:
- Public GitHub showing real work
- Own automation for your business
- Client implementations visible

**Marketing Message**: 
"We don't just teach automation—we build it every day. Here's our GitHub to prove it."

This is POWERFUL differentiation from typical consultants.
