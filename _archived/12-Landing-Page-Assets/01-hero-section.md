# Hero Section Update

## Current Hero Section (ai-whisperers.org)

```
Whisper AI into Action

Enterprise-grade AI solutions that save you time, money, and energy.

[See Projects] [Get in Touch]
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ "Whisper AI into Action" - Clever but unclear
- ❌ "Save time, money, energy" - Generic, every consultant says this
- ❌ No differentiation or unique value
- ❌ No lead capture CTA
- ❌ Missing your biggest advantage (GitHub proof)

---

## New Hero Section

### HEADLINE (H1)
```
AI automation solutions to real poblems, we help you be eficient 
```

**Why This Works**:
- Direct and clear
- Addresses skepticism ("actually works")
- Immediately communicates what you do
- SEO-friendly

---

### SUBHEADLINE (H2)
```
Check our GitHub: we ship real solutions, not slide decks.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Introduces your unique advantage (GitHub)
- Action-oriented language
- Builds trust through transparency

---

### VALUE PROPOSITION (Paragraph)
```
Cut operational costs by 40%. Save 10+ hours per week. 
```

**Why This Works**:
- Specific metrics (40%, 10+ hours)
- Clear outcomes
- Time-bound promise
- Focuses on results, not features

---

### TRUST INDICATORS (Below Value Prop)
```
✓ Open Source on GitHub | ✓ Enterprise-Grade Solutions
```

**Customize These Numbers**
- If unsure, use conservative estimate
- Can also use: "Trusted by [X] Companies"

---

### CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS

**Primary CTA (Large, High Contrast)**:
```

```
- Links to: `/free-ai-audit` (lead magnet page)

**Secondary CTA (Outline Button)**:
