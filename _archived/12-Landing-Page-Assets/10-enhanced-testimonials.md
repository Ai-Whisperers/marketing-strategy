# Enhanced Testimonials Section

## Current Testimonials (ai-whisperers.org)

### WPG Software:
> "Great collaboration with tangible results. the updated website is amazing."

### WPG Amenities:
> "Professional, fast, and innovative. Their portfolio solution exceeded our expectations."

**Problem**: These are good but lack specifics—no metrics, no context, no transformation story

## Enhanced Testimonial Strategy

### What Makes a Great Testimonial:

✅ **Specific results** (numbers, time saved, money earned)  
✅ **Before/after transformation** (what changed)  
✅ **Emotional element** (how it felt)  
✅ **Credible source** (name, title, company, photo)  
✅ **Authentic voice** (sounds real, not scripted)

### Example:

Hi, I'm Sarah from WPG Software.

Before working with AI Whisperers, our client onboarding was completely

They automated our entire process, and within 3 weeks, we cut that time 
to under an hour per week.

The best part? Our clients love the new experience—it's faster and more 
professional.

If you're drowning in manual work, I highly recommend AI Whisperers. 
They actually deliver what they promise.
