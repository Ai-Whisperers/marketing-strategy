### CONTENT

```
We're not your typical AI consultants.

We're a team of engineers and automation specialists who believe in 
transparency, open source, and showing our work.

While other consultants create PowerPoint decks, we ship code. 
While they talk about AI's potential, we build working implementations.

Our mission is simple: Make AI automation accessible, practical, and 
profitable for businesses of all sizes.

We do this by:
• Building in public (check our GitHub)
• Sharing our frameworks open source
• Teaching what we learn
• Delivering measurable results

Founded in [Year], we've helped 50+ companies cut operational costs 
by an average of 40% while improving output. From solopreneurs to 
enterprises, we bring the same commitment to results.

      <p class="lead">
        AI Whisperers is on a mission to make AI automation accessible, 
        practical, and profitable for businesses of all sizes.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      
      <div class="story-content">
        <p>
          AI Whisperers was born from frustration.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We saw businesses drowning in repetitive work—spending hours on tasks 
          that could be automated in minutes. Meanwhile, AI consultants charged 
          six figures for strategy decks that never became reality.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          There had to be a better way.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          So we started building. First for ourselves—automating our own time 
          tracking, reporting, and workflows. When we saved 20+ hours per week, 
          we knew we had something.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We shared our tools on GitHub. The response was immediate. 
          "Can you help us do this?" became a common question.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That's how AI Whisperers became a company. We don't just consult—we 
          implement. We don't hide behind NDAs—we build in public. We don't 
          promise magic—we deliver measurable results.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Today, we've helped 50+ companies across industries automate their 
          operations, reduce costs by an average of 40%, and reclaim thousands 
          of hours.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But we're just getting started.

        <p class="large-text">
          Make AI automation accessible, practical, and profitable

        <div class="mission-point">
          <h3>Accessible</h3>
          <p>
            AI automation shouldn't require a PhD or a six-figure budget. 
            We make it simple enough for non-technical teams to understand 
            and use.

        <div class="mission-point">
          <h3>Practical</h3>
          <p>
            No buzzwords, no hype, no theoretical frameworks. We build 
            automations that solve real problems and deliver measurable 
            outcomes.

        <div class="mission-point">
          <h3>Profitable</h3>
          <p>
            Every automation should have clear ROI. We focus on implementations 
            that save time, reduce costs, and generate revenue—not just 
            "interesting tech."
