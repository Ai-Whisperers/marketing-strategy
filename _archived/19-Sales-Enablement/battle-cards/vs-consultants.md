# Battle Card: vs Traditional Consultants

> When competing against traditional business/management consultants

---

## Who They Are

**Examples**: McKinsey, Deloitte, local management consultants, business advisors

**What they offer**: Strategic advice, process optimization, change management

**Typical engagement**: 3-6 month projects, heavy on strategy, light on implementation

---

## Their Pitch

> "We bring decades of experience and proven methodologies. We'll assess your business, develop a comprehensive strategy, and guide your transformation."

---

## Their Strengths

- **Brand credibility** - Known names, impressive client lists
- **Strategic thinking** - Good at big-picture analysis
- **Executive relationships** - Access to C-suite
- **Resources** - Large teams for big projects
- **Frameworks** - Established methodologies

---

## Their Weaknesses

- **Slow** - Months of analysis before any action
- **Expensive** - $200-500+/hour, big project minimums
- **Strategy-heavy** - Often leaves client to implement
- **Junior execution** - Partners sell, juniors deliver
- **Not tech-native** - AI/automation is add-on, not core
- **Outdated approaches** - Traditional methods for modern problems

---

## How We Win

### Our Advantages

| Their Weakness | Our Strength |
|----------------|--------------|
| Months to see results | Days to first results |
| $100K+ minimums | Projects from $5K |
| Strategy without implementation | We implement |
| Junior staff doing work | Founder-led delivery |
| AI is afterthought | AI-native, it's all we do |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Speed**: We implement in weeks, not months
2. **Implementation**: We don't just recommend, we build
3. **Modern**: AI-first, not AI-afterthought
4. **Accessible**: SMB-friendly pricing
5. **Founder-led**: Senior talent on every project

## Talking Points

### When They Say: "We have decades of experience"

**You Say**:
> "Experience in traditional methods is valuable, but AI automation requires a different skillset. We're native to this technology - it's all we do, every day. That focused expertise means faster implementation and better results."

### When They Say: "We'll develop a comprehensive strategy first"

**You Say**:
> "Strategy is important, but too much planning delays results. We take a different approach: identify a high-impact quick win, implement it in weeks, prove ROI, then expand. You see results while big consultants are still analyzing."

### When They Say: "We work with Fortune 500 companies"

**You Say**:
> "That's great for Fortune 500, but their approaches don't always translate to businesses your size. We specialize in making enterprise-grade AI accessible to smaller companies - same results, fraction of the cost and complexity."

---

## Objection Handling

### "They have a bigger team"

> "Bigger isn't always better. Their large teams often mean junior staff doing the actual work while partners move on. We're a small, senior team where you get our best people, not fresh graduates learning on your project."

### "They have a proven track record"

> "Their track record is in traditional consulting. AI automation is a different game with different skills. Check our case studies - [specific results]. That's the relevant track record for what you need."

### "They understand our industry"

> "Industry knowledge matters, but the automation principles apply across industries. We've successfully implemented for [similar industry]. And honestly, sometimes outside perspective catches opportunities that insiders miss."

## Questions to Ask the Prospect

Expose consultant weaknesses:

1. "When they're done with the strategy, who implements it?"
2. "How long until you see actual results, not just recommendations?"
3. "Who specifically will be doing the work on your project?"
4. "What's their specific experience with AI automation?"
5. "Have you seen results from their past strategy engagements?"

---

## Win/Loss Notes

### We Won When:
- Client valued speed over exhaustive planning
- Client had been burned by "all strategy, no action"
- Budget didn't support big firm minimums
- Client wanted implementation, not recommendations
- AI/automation was core need

### We Lost When:
- Client needed brand-name credibility for board
- Project was primarily organizational change
- Existing relationship with big firm
- Client valued strategy document deliverables

## Case Study to Reference

> "[Client] came to us after spending $150K on a consulting engagement that produced a beautiful strategy deck but no actual automation. In 6 weeks, we implemented what they'd been planning for 6 months - at 1/10th the cost."

---

## Quick Reference

**When you hear**: "We're also talking to [big consulting firm]"

**Your response**: "Great - they do good strategy work. A few questions that might help you compare: How long until you see actual results with them? Who specifically does the implementation work? And what's their specific AI automation experience? We find clients value our approach because we go from analysis to results in weeks, not months, and our senior team does the actual work."
