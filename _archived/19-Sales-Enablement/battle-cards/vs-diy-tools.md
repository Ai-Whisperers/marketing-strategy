# Battle Card: vs DIY Tools

> When competing against self-service automation platforms

---

## Who They Are

**Examples**: Zapier, Make (Integromat), n8n, Power Automate, IFTTT

**What they offer**: Self-service automation platforms, connect apps, build workflows

**Typical cost**: $0-100/month for the tool

---

## Their Pitch

> "Easy automation for everyone. Connect your apps in minutes. No coding required. Build workflows yourself and save money."

---

## Their Strengths

- **Low cost** - Free tiers, affordable paid plans
- **Easy to start** - Templates, drag-and-drop
- **Immediate access** - Sign up and go
- **Control** - You own the implementation
- **Large ecosystem** - 1000s of app integrations

---

## Their Weaknesses

- **DIY = DI-Wrong** - Most people build suboptimal automations
- **No strategy** - Tools don't tell you WHAT to automate
- **Time investment** - Learning curve, ongoing maintenance
- **Limited complexity** - Hits walls with advanced needs
- **No accountability** - If it breaks, it's your problem
- **Scope creep** - Easy to spend months tinkering

---

## How We Win

### Our Advantages

| Their Weakness | Our Strength |
|----------------|--------------|
| You figure out what to automate | We identify highest-impact opportunities |
| Learning curve | We implement for you |
| Ongoing maintenance | We support and optimize |
| Hits complexity walls | We handle complex scenarios |
| No one to call when stuck | Dedicated support |
| Tinkering without results | Results-focused delivery |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Strategy**: We identify WHAT to automate, not just HOW
2. **Speed**: We implement in days what takes months to DIY
3. **Expertise**: We know the pitfalls and best practices
4. **Results**: We measure ROI, not just "working automation"
5. **Support**: Ongoing help vs you're on your own

## Talking Points

### When They Say: "We can do this ourselves with Zapier"

**You Say**:
> "You absolutely can - Zapier is a great tool. The question is whether that's the best use of your time. Most DIY automations take 3-5x longer than expected, and I've seen businesses spend months tinkering without seeing real ROI. We can implement the same automation in a week, properly structured, so you can focus on running your business."

### When They Say: "It's so much cheaper to DIY"

**You Say**:
> "The tool cost is cheap, but your time isn't. If you or your team spend 20 hours figuring out an automation that saves 2 hours a week, you're underwater for months. Plus, the biggest cost isn't implementation - it's not knowing what to automate first. We've seen businesses automate the wrong things for months. Strategy saves more than DIY saves on tools."

### When They Say: "We want to learn to do it ourselves"

**You Say**:
> "I love that mindset - and we can help with that too. Our approach can include training so your team can maintain and extend what we build. You get the best of both: fast, professional implementation now, plus the skills to evolve it yourself."

---

## Objection Handling

### "Our team can figure it out"

> "They probably can, eventually. But 'eventually' is the problem. How many hours will they spend? What else won't get done? And what if they build something that works but isn't optimal? We bring pattern recognition from 50+ implementations. We know what works and what doesn't. That means faster results and better architecture."

### "We've already started building automations"

> "That's great - you've got momentum. Let us audit what you've built. Often, we find quick optimizations that dramatically improve what's already there. And we can extend it to the next level of complexity that DIY tools make difficult."

### "We don't want to be dependent on a vendor"

> "Totally understand. Everything we build uses standard tools like Zapier, Make, or native integrations - nothing proprietary. You own everything. We also document thoroughly and can train your team to maintain it. If we disappeared tomorrow, you'd be fine."

## The Real Cost of DIY

### Time Cost Calculation

**DIY Path**:
- Learning the tool: 10-20 hours
- Building v1: 10-30 hours
- Debugging and fixing: 10-20 hours
- Maintenance per month: 2-5 hours
- Total first year: 80-150+ hours

**With Us**:
- Your time: 2-5 hours (meetings, review)
- Our implementation: Done in days
- Time saved: 75-145 hours in year one

### Opportunity Cost

> "What else could you accomplish with 100 hours? One new client at $10K covers our fee and you still have 100 hours of your life back."

---

## Questions to Ask the Prospect

1. "How many hours have you already spent trying to set this up?"
2. "What's the hourly value of the person who'd be doing this?"
3. "What else isn't getting done while you're learning automation tools?"
4. "How confident are you that you're automating the right things?"
5. "What happens when you hit a wall or something breaks?"

---

## Win/Loss Notes

### We Won When:
- Client had already tried DIY and struggled
- Client's time was more valuable than our fee
- Automation needed was complex
- Client valued speed over cost savings
- Client wanted strategy, not just implementation

### We Lost When:
- Very price-sensitive, willing to invest time
- Simple automation well within DIY capability
- Client enjoys technical tinkering
- No budget for external help

---

## Positioning

### For Simple Automations
> "You're right that this is achievable with DIY tools. The question is whether your time is best spent there. We can do it in a fraction of the time, properly structured, with documentation. Worth considering."

### For Complex Automations
> "This is exactly where DIY tools hit their limits. What looks simple in demos gets complicated fast. We've built this pattern many times - we know the edge cases and pitfalls. Let us handle the complex stuff while you handle your business."

### For "Let's Start DIY, Then Call You"
> "Fair enough. I'd suggest starting with the simplest automation on your list. If it goes smoothly and you enjoy the process, keep going. If you hit walls or find it's taking longer than expected, reach out. We're here when you need us."

## Quick Reference

**When you hear**: "We're going to try doing this ourselves first"

**Your response**: "Makes sense - Zapier and similar tools are great for simple automations. A few things to consider: First, most DIY projects take 3-5x longer than expected. Second, the tool is the easy part - knowing what to automate and how to structure it is where the real value is. If you hit walls or find it's taking too long, we're here. And even if you DIY successfully, we're happy to do an audit to make sure you're not missing opportunities."
