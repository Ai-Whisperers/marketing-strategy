## The Challenge

### Background
Like many small auto shops, Taller Ocampos was drowning in paperwork. The owner was spending more time on administration than on actual repair work or growing the business.

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Invoice Creation**: Each invoice took 45 minutes to create manually, including looking up parts, calculating labor, and formatting the document.

2. **Customer Communication**: Follow-ups with customers about completed repairs, maintenance reminders, and quotes were inconsistent - often forgotten entirely during busy periods.

3. **Scheduling Chaos**: Appointments were managed on paper calendars and whiteboards, leading to double-bookings and confusion.

4. **Parts Inventory**: No system for tracking parts inventory, leading to delays when common parts weren't in stock.

### What They Had Tried Before
- Spreadsheets (too complex, not maintained)
- Generic CRM software (too expensive, too complicated)
- Paper systems (worked, but very time-consuming)

### The Breaking Point
During a particularly busy month, the owner realized he was working 12-hour days just to keep up with paperwork - and still missing customer follow-ups. Something had to change.
