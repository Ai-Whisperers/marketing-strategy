## Why LinkedIn for B2B

- **Professional context** - People are in work mode
- **Precise targeting** - Job title, company size, industry
- **Decision makers** - Reach actual buyers
- **Higher intent** - Business-focused browsing

**The trade-off**: LinkedIn is expensive ($5-15+ per click), so you need strong offers and high conversion rates.
