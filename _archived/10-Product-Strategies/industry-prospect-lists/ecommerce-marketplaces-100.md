## NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

1. **China dominance**: Top Chinese platforms (Alibaba, JD, Pinduoduo, SHEIN, Temu) represent massive TAM but may require local partnerships

2. **LATAM opportunity**: Strong scores and accessibility make LATAM (especially Brazil) ideal for initial traction

3. **SEA emerging**: Southeast Asia platforms growing rapidly, high training needs, accessible decision-makers

4. **Marketplace vs. Retail**: Marketplaces have higher comment analyzer need (seller disputes, fraud), retailers have higher training need

5. **DTC brands**: Lower scores overall but faster sales cycles and good for case studies

6. **Luxury segment**: Different approach needed (white-glove service, confidentiality)

7. **Resale/Recommerce**: Growing segment with unique trust & safety needs

8. **Global platforms**: May need multi-region approach (separate deals per region)
