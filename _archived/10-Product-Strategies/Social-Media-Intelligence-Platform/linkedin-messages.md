## Template 2: Free Report Offer (3-5 days after connection)

Hi [Name]!

I did something a bit unusual - I analyzed [Company]'s last 500 Instagram comments with AI and found some interesting insights:

• Your sentiment dropped 15% in the last 2 weeks
• Top pain point: [specific issue] (mentioned 47 times)
• 23 customers at high churn risk

I created a full report for you (23-page Excel analysis). Want me to send it over? It's free, no strings attached. Just thought you'd find it valuable.

P.S. This normally takes an analyst 10+ hours. Our AI did it in 5 minutes.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Variables to customize**:
- [Name] - Their first name
- [Company] - Company name
- Sentiment stat (customize based on actual data)
- Pain point (customize based on actual analysis)
- Churn stat (customize based on actual data)

**Expected response rate**: 30-40%

**Use when**: Sent free report offer but got no reply

```
Hey [Name],

Just wanted to make sure you saw my message about the social media sentiment analysis I did for [Company].

I have a detailed 23-page report with:
✅ Sentiment trends (positive/negative)
✅ Top customer pain points
✅ Churn risk analysis
✅ Unanswered questions costing you sales

Should I send it over? Happy to walk you through it on a quick 10-min call if helpful.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Expected response rate**: 10-15% (of non-responders)

---

## Template 4: Value-Add Content Share (Ongoing nurture)

**Use when**: Sharing valuable content to stay top-of-mind

```
[Name] - thought you'd find this interesting:

We analyzed 10,000 social media comments from [Industry] brands in LATAM and found the top 3 pain points causing churn:

1. [Pain point 1] - mentioned in 37% of negative comments
2. [Pain point 2] - 28%
3. [Pain point 3] - 22%

Full report here: [Link]

Is [Company] seeing similar patterns?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Variables to customize**:
- [Industry] - Their industry
- Pain points - Real data from industry research

**Purpose**: Build credibility + stay top-of-mind

---

## Template 5: Post-Demo Follow-Up (Same day after demo)

**Use when**: Immediately after demo call

```
[Name] - great talking with you today!

Quick recap of what we covered:
• Your current analysis takes 40 hours/month (costing $2,500)
• Our platform does it in 5 minutes for $1,497/month
• Net savings: $1,000/month + better insights

Next steps:
1. I'll send the full report we generated during the demo
2. Review with your team
3. Let's reconnect [Day of week] to discuss any questions

I've scheduled our follow-up for [Date/Time] - calendar invite coming shortly.

Looking forward to helping [Company] reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## Template 6: Overcoming "No Budget" Objection

**Use when**: Prospect says they don't have budget

```
[Name], I totally understand budget constraints.

Quick question: How much does [Company] currently spend on social media management or customer service? [Wait for response]

Here's the thing - our platform typically saves 30-40 hours per month vs manual analysis. That's $1,500-2,500 in labor cost.

Would it make sense to start with just 1 account at $497/month? That's $16/day to analyze 2,000 comments automatically. If we can document 20+ hours saved in the first 30 days, would that free up budget?

Plus we have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so zero risk.

Want to try a pilot?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## Template 7: Competitive Situation (They already use a tool)

**Use when**: Prospect mentions they use Brandwatch, Hootsuite, etc.

```
[Name], that's great you're already using [Competitor tool]!

Quick question: Are you happy with it? What's working well? What's missing?

I ask because most of our customers switched from [Competitor] for 3 reasons:

1. **LATAM Context**: We understand Spanish/Portuguese slang and cultural nuances (not just direct translation)
2. **Churn Prediction**: We predict which customers are about to leave (not just sentiment)
3. **Better Reports**: 23-sheet Excel with executive summaries (vs basic dashboard)

How about a side-by-side test? We'll analyze the same dataset with both tools and compare the insights. No cost, no commitment.

Interested?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

## Template 8: Re-Engagement (60-90 days after initial contact)

**Use when**: Prospect went cold after initial interest

```
[Name] - hope you're doing well!

I know we talked about social media sentiment analysis a few months back. I wanted to reach out because we just launched some new features that might be relevant:

✅ Real-time alerts (get notified within 15 min of sentiment spikes)
✅ Competitive intelligence (track your brand vs 3 competitors)
✅ Google Sheets integration (automatic report delivery)

Also, I noticed [Company] had [recent event - product launch, crisis, viral post]. Did that impact your social sentiment? I can run a quick analysis if you'd like.

Want to reconnect for 15 minutes?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## Template 9: Asking for Referral (From happy customer)

**Use when**: Customer has been using platform for 3+ months successfully

```
[Name] - I'm so glad our platform is working well for [Company]!

Quick favor: Do you know any other Marketing Directors or Customer Service Leaders who might benefit from what we're doing?

We're specifically looking for companies with:
✅ >50K social media followers
✅ High comment volume
✅ Customer service or churn challenges

I'd love to offer them the same free analysis we did for you. Would you be open to making an introduction?

Happy to send you our referral program details (we give you 10% recurring commission for any referral that becomes a customer).

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

## Template 10: Agency Partnership Pitch

**Use when**: Reaching out to social media agencies

```
[Name] - saw that [Agency name] manages social media for several LATAM brands.

I run a social media intelligence platform and wanted to explore a potential partnership. Here's the idea:

**White-Label Option**: You can resell our platform under your brand to your clients

**What you get**:
✅ 40% margin (buy at $1,500, sell at $2,500)
✅ White-label reports with your branding
✅ Multi-client dashboard (manage all clients in one place)
✅ Co-marketing opportunities

**What your clients get**:
✅ Automated comment extraction from 5 platforms
✅ AI sentiment analysis + churn prediction
✅ Professional 23-sheet Excel reports

This saves your team 5-10 hours per client per month (that's $5K-20K/month in billable time for a 20-client agency).
