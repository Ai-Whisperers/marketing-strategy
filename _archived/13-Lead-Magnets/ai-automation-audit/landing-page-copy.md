### Problem Section

**Section Header**: Sound Familiar?

You started your business to do work you love. But now you spend more time on admin, emails, and "keeping things running" than on actually growing your business.

**Pain Points** (with icons):

📧 **Drowning in email** - Hours spent on messages that could be automated

📋 **Endless manual tasks** - Data entry, reports, updates that never end

⏰ **No time to think** - Too busy working IN the business to work ON it

🔥 **Always firefighting** - Reacting instead of planning

😤 **Team bottlenecks** - Good people doing low-value work

**Transition**: It doesn't have to be this way.
