## Email 1: Quick Win (Day 2)

**Subject**: The one automation everyone should start with

**Preview**: Takes 10 minutes to set up, saves hours every week...

---

Hi [First Name],

Did you complete your audit yet?

If not, no judgment - I know you're busy. (That's kind of the whole point, right?)

While you're thinking about it, here's the **one automation I recommend to literally everyone**:

**Calendar scheduling automation.**

If you're still doing the "what times work for you?" email dance, stop.

Set up Calendly (free) or a similar tool:
- Shows your real availability
- Lets people book directly
- Sends automatic reminders
- Syncs with your calendar

**Time to set up**: 10 minutes
**Time saved**: 2-5 hours/month minimum

This is the gateway drug of automation. Once you see how easy it is, you'll want more.

Here's a quick guide to set it up: [Link or brief instructions]

What else did your audit reveal? Hit reply and tell me your #1 opportunity - I'm curious.

## Email 2: Case Study (Day 4)

**Subject**: How [Client] found 15 hours hiding in their business

**Preview**: They were skeptical too. Then they ran the numbers...

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick story about a business owner just like you.

[Client Name] runs a [type of business] with [X] employees. When they did the AI Automation Audit, they were skeptical.

"I've tried automation before," they said. "It never sticks."

But the audit revealed something they hadn't seen:

**They were spending 18 hours per week on tasks that could be automated.**

Not "might" be automated. Could be. Today. With tools that already exist.

Here's what they automated first:
- Invoice generation (45 min → 5 min each)
- Customer follow-up emails (automatic)
- Meeting scheduling (eliminated the back-and-forth)
- Weekly report creation (automatic)

**Result**: 15+ hours recovered per week. That's almost 2 full workdays.

The ROI? Let's just say the automation paid for itself in the first month.

**Your audit might reveal similar opportunities.** Did anything surprise you when you completed it?

## Email 3: Common Mistakes (Day 7)

**Subject**: 3 automation mistakes that waste time and money

**Preview**: Don't make #2 - almost everyone does...

---

Hi [First Name],

After helping 50+ businesses with automation, I've seen the same mistakes over and over.

Here are the big three:

**Mistake #1: Automating the wrong things first**

People often automate what's easiest instead of what's most impactful. Your audit has an Impact × Ease matrix for exactly this reason. High impact first, always.

**Mistake #2: Trying to automate a broken process**

If your process is messy, automation just makes messy happen faster. Sometimes you need to fix the process before you automate it.

**Mistake #3: Going too big too fast**

I've seen companies spend months planning a "complete digital transformation" when they could have saved 10 hours/week with a simple email automation in one afternoon. Start small. Get wins. Build momentum.

**The antidote to all three**: Focus on ONE high-impact, well-defined process. Automate it. Measure results. Then move to the next.

What was your #1 opportunity from the audit? If you share it, I'll tell you if it's a good place to start.

P.S. - Still haven't done the audit? No shame. Here's the link: [Link]. It's only 15 minutes and it might change how you think about your business.

## Email 4: Direct CTA (Day 10)

**Subject**: Can I help you with [audit result]?

**Preview**: 15 minutes, no pitch, just practical advice...

---

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short.

If you've completed the audit (or even just thought about it), you probably have questions:

- "Is this opportunity really worth pursuing?"
- "What tools would actually work for my situation?"
- "How long would this take to implement?"
- "Where do I even start?"

I answer these questions for free. No pitch, no "discovery call" that's really a sales presentation. Just 15 minutes of practical advice.

**Here's what you'll get**:
- Validation of your priorities
- Specific tool recommendations
- Realistic timeline expectations
- Honest answers to your questions

[Book 15 minutes with me →]

If automation isn't right for you, I'll tell you that too. I'd rather be helpful than salesy.

## Email 5: Soft Close (Day 14)

**Subject**: Last thought on your automation potential

**Preview**: A resource whether we talk or not...

---

Hi [First Name],

This is my last email about the audit (promise!).

Whether you completed it, skimmed it, or it's still sitting in your downloads folder - I want to leave you with something useful.

**The One Question That Matters**:

"If I could wave a magic wand and give you 10 extra hours per week, what would you do with them?"

If the answer excites you - more strategic work, better customer relationships, actual time off, growing the business - then automation is worth exploring.

If the answer is "I don't know" - that's worth exploring too.

**Two options**:

1. **DIY Route**: Use the audit framework. Pick your #1 opportunity. Google tools that can help. Experiment. It works, it just takes longer.

2. **Guided Route**: [Book a call →] and I'll point you in the right direction. 15 minutes, no strings.

Either way, I hope the audit gave you some clarity. That was the goal.

Good luck,
