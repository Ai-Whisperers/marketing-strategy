Hi [Name],

I'll keep this brief.

I'm reaching out because [Company] seems like a great fit for our AI training programs. We help teams at companies like yours boost productivity by 30-50% with practical AI skills.

One more quick note - then I'll leave you alone!

Results after 30 days:

• 25% fewer bugs in production

The training was 2 days, and they saw ROI within the first month.

If [Company] is looking to improve team productivity, I'd love to share more details.

Open to a quick call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## Email 4: Break-Up Email (Day 14)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about AI training for [Company] and haven't heard back - which is totally fine!

I don't want to keep bothering you, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If things change in the future, here's what we offer:
• Foundation courses for all employees (4-8 hours)
• Technical training for developers and QA (2-16 days)
• Specialized programs for sales, marketing, and customer service

Feel free to reach out anytime - my inbox is always open.

Wishing you and the team at [Company] continued success!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If someone else at [Company] would be better to talk to about training, I'd appreciate the introduction!

# 6. Phone Script

## Opening (First 30 seconds)

```
Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from AI Whisperers.

Do you have a quick minute?

[If yes, continue]

Great! I'll be brief. I'm calling because we help companies like [Company] train their teams on AI tools - and companies in [industry] have been seeing great results.

I'm not trying to sell you anything on this call - just wanted to see if AI training is something [Company] is exploring this year.

[Pause for response]
```

---

## Discovery Questions

```
That's helpful to know. A few quick questions to see if we might be a fit:

1. "How is your team currently using AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot?"

2. "What's your biggest challenge when it comes to team productivity?"

3. "Have you invested in any AI training programs before?"

4. "Who typically makes decisions about professional development at [Company]?"

5. "What would success look like if your team was fully AI-enabled?"
```

---

## Value Proposition (Based on Responses)

### For Productivity Concerns:
```
That makes sense. What we hear from a lot of companies is that their teams are using AI, but not effectively.

Our training programs typically help teams save 5-10 hours per week per employee. For a team of [X] people, that's [calculate] hours back every week.
```

### For Developer Teams:
```
Interesting. Our AI-Assisted Software Development program specifically addresses that.

Developers who complete it typically see 40-60% faster coding, better code quality, and significantly less time on documentation. It's a 2-day investment with ROI usually within the first month.
```

### For QA Teams:
```
QA is actually our specialty. We have a comprehensive 12-module course that transforms manual QA engineers into AI-augmented automation specialists.

It covers Playwright, CI/CD integration, and AI-assisted testing. Students build a complete test automation framework by the end.
```

---

## Handling Objections

### "We're not interested right now"
```
Totally understand. Can I ask - is it a budget issue, timing, or just not a priority?

[Listen]

That makes sense. Would it be okay if I checked back in [3 months]? In the meantime, I can send over some free resources your team might find useful.
```

### "We already use AI tools"
```
That's great! Most companies we work with are in the same boat. The question is - are they using them effectively?

What we find is that without proper training, teams use maybe 20% of what AI can do. Our programs unlock the other 80%.

Would a quick assessment of your team's AI maturity be helpful?
```

### "Send me some information"
```
Happy to! What would be most useful -

A. Our full course catalog with all 12 programs?
B. A specific proposal for [department they mentioned]?
C. Case studies from companies in [their industry]?

I'll send that over today. What's the best email?

And just so I can follow up appropriately - when do you think you'll have a chance to review it?
```

### "What does it cost?"
```
Great question. It depends on the program and team size.

For example:
- A half-day workshop for 25 people runs $4,000-8,000
- Our 2-day developer training is $8,000-15,000 for up to 20 people
- We also have individual enrollment options starting at $149

The ROI is typically within the first month - we can show you the math.

What size team are you thinking about?
```

---

## Closing

### If Interested:
```
Excellent! Here's what I suggest as next steps:

1. I'll send you [specific materials discussed]
2. Let's schedule a 30-minute call with [decision maker if different] to dive deeper
3. We can put together a custom proposal for [Company]

Does [specific day/time] work for that follow-up call?

Great - I'll send a calendar invite right after we hang up. Looking forward to it!
```

### If Not Ready:
```
I completely understand. Here's what I'll do:

1. Send you our course catalog and a few relevant case studies
2. Add a reminder to follow up in [timeframe they mentioned]
3. You have my number if anything changes before then

Thanks for your time today, [Name]. Good luck with [something they mentioned]!
