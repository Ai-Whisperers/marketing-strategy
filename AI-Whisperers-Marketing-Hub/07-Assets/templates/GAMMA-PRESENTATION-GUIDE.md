## Best Practices for Content Preparation

### The Golden Rules

Based on [Skywork's research](https://skywork.ai/blog/best-prompt-patterns-gamma-ai-presentation-2025/):

1. **Start with outcome + audience, not theme**
   - Bad: "AI automation presentation"
   - Good: "Sales pitch deck for SME operations managers showing ROI of AI automation"

2. **Approve outline before slides**
   - Use two-step process: outline → adjust → generate
   - This prevents having to redo entire decks

3. **Constrain density upfront**
   - Set slide count (e.g., "10-12 slides")
   - Set bullets-per-slide (e.g., "max 5 bullets per slide")
   - Specify visuals needed

4. **Use negative prompts**
   - "Avoid clichés and generic stock phrases"
   - "No AI-generated people images"
   - "Don't use jargon"

### Content Structure for Paste Mode

When pasting content into Gamma, structure it like this:

```markdown
# Main Title

## Section 1: [Topic]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Supporting data

## Section 2: [Topic]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Supporting data

[Continue pattern...]
```

Gamma uses headings (# and ##) to create slide divisions.

## Ready-to-Use Presentation Content

### Slide Content Blocks

Copy these directly into Gamma's "Paste" mode:

```
# The Hidden Cost of Manual Processes

## Your Team is Drowning in Repetitive Work

- **10-25 hours per week** spent on tasks AI could handle
- **80-90% of errors** come from manual data entry
- **$47,000+ per year** in lost productivity (average SME)

## The Math Nobody Does

At $60/hour blended rate:
- 15 hours/week × $60 × 52 weeks = **$46,800/year**
- That's one employee's salary... doing work a bot could do
