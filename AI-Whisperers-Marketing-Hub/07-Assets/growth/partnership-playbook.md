## What is a Partnership?

A formal relationship with a complementary business where you:
- Refer business to each other
- Co-create content or offers
- Access each other's audiences
- Potentially share revenue

**Different from referrals**: Partnerships are ongoing relationships, not one-time introductions.

## Types of Partnerships

### 1. Referral Partnerships
**How it works**: You refer clients to them, they refer clients to you
**Best for**: Complementary service providers
**Example**: We partner with a CRM consultant - we automate, they implement

### 2. Reseller Partnerships
**How it works**: Partner sells your service, earns commission
**Best for**: Partners with sales capacity
**Example**: A digital agency includes our automation as part of their offering

### 3. Integration Partnerships
**How it works**: Your services technically connect
**Best for**: Software/tool providers
**Example**: We implement using their platform, we're listed as certified partner

### 4. Co-Marketing Partnerships
**How it works**: Create content or events together
**Best for**: Non-competing businesses with similar audiences
**Example**: Joint webinar on "AI + CRM: Better Together"

### 5. Strategic Alliances
**How it works**: Deep collaboration on go-to-market
**Best for**: Highly aligned businesses
**Example**: Exclusive partnership to serve a specific vertical
