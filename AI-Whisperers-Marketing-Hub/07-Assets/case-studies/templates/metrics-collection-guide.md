## Metrics to Collect

### Time-Based Metrics
| Metric | How to Measure | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Hours saved per week | Before/after time tracking | "8 hrs → 2 hrs" |
| Task completion time | Time to complete one unit | "45 min → 5 min" |
| Response time | Time to respond to requests | "24 hrs → 2 hrs" |
| Implementation time | Project duration | "3 months → 3 weeks" |

### Cost-Based Metrics
| Metric | How to Measure | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Labor cost reduction | Hours × hourly rate | "$2,000/mo saved" |
| Error cost reduction | Errors × cost per error | "$500/mo saved" |
| Tool consolidation | Previous tools - new tools | "$300/mo saved" |
| Revenue increase | New revenue attributed | "+$10K/mo" |

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | How to Measure | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Error rate | Errors / total tasks | "5% → 0.5%" |
| Customer satisfaction | NPS or CSAT scores | "7.2 → 8.9" |
| Completion rate | Completed / started | "60% → 95%" |
| Accuracy | Correct / total | "85% → 99%" |

### Volume Metrics
| Metric | How to Measure | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Tasks processed | Count per period | "50 → 500/day" |
| Leads generated | New leads per month | "10 → 100/mo" |
| Customers served | Active customers | "100 → 500" |

## Collection Methods

### 1. Client Interview (30 min)

**Questions to ask:**

**Before State**
- "Walk me through how [process] worked before we started."
- "How much time did you/your team spend on [task] per week?"
- "What was the biggest frustration with the old way?"
- "What had you tried before that didn't work?"

**After State**
- "How does [process] work now?"
- "How much time does it take now?"
- "What's the biggest difference you've noticed?"
- "What can you do now that you couldn't before?"

**Results**
- "If you had to put a number on the improvement, what would it be?"
- "What's the ROI been for you?"
- "What would you tell someone considering this?"

### 2. Data Pull

**Ask client for:**
- Screenshots of before/after dashboards
- Reports showing metrics over time
- Time tracking data (if available)
- Financial reports (costs, revenue)

**Tools to check:**
- Google Analytics (traffic, conversions)
- CRM data (leads, sales cycle)
- Project management tools (task completion)
- Financial software (costs, revenue)

### 3. Observation

**During the project, document:**
- How long tasks take (time yourself)
- Number of steps in a process
- Error rates you observe
- Feedback from users

## ROI Calculation Templates

### Time Savings ROI
```
Hours saved per week: [X]
Hourly rate of person doing task: $[Y]
Weekly savings: X × Y = $[Z]
Monthly savings: Z × 4 = $[A]
Annual savings: A × 12 = $[B]

Investment: $[C]
ROI: (B - C) / C × 100 = [D]%
Payback period: C / (B/12) = [E] months
```

### Cost Reduction ROI
```
Previous monthly costs: $[X]
  - Tool A: $[a]
  - Tool B: $[b]
  - Labor: $[c]

New monthly costs: $[Y]
  - Our solution: $[d]
  - Remaining labor: $[e]

Monthly savings: X - Y = $[Z]
Annual savings: Z × 12 = $[A]

Investment: $[B]
ROI: (A - B) / B × 100 = [C]%
```

### Revenue Impact ROI
```
New revenue per month: $[X]
Attribution to solution: [Y]%
Monthly attributed revenue: X × Y = $[Z]
Annual attributed revenue: Z × 12 = $[A]

Investment: $[B]
ROI: (A - B) / B × 100 = [C]%
```

## Making Numbers Compelling

### Good vs. Great Metrics

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Saved time" | "Saved 6 hours per week" |
| "Reduced costs" | "Cut costs by 40% ($2,000/mo)" |
| "Improved efficiency" | "10x faster processing" |
| "Better results" | "Error rate dropped from 5% to 0.5%" |

### Framing Tips

**Use comparisons:**
- "From 8 hours to 2 hours" (not "75% reduction")
- "What took a day now takes 10 minutes"
- "One person can now do what took a team of 3"

**Use time frames:**
- "In just 30 days..."
- "Within the first week..."
- "After 90 days..."

**Use relatable numbers:**
- "That's like getting back a full workday every week"
- "Equivalent to hiring another full-time employee"
- "Pays for itself in less than 2 months"
