# Services & Pricing Section

## Purpose

Make it crystal clear what you offer, what's included, and how much it costs.

**Problem**: Visitors don't know what you sell or if they can afford it
**Solution**: Simple hourly/fixed pricing structure with transparent rates

---

## Our Pricing Model

We use a straightforward pricing model: hourly rates for development work, fixed prices for consulting and automations, and monthly fees for hosting.

**Our Promise**: "It will work. And it won't take forever."
