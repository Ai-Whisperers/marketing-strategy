- **Reputation Gap**: Despite huge investments, the public often doesn't give them credit (Communication failure).
- **Historical Debt**: Constant pressure to repay "social debt" to indigenous communities and displaced groups.
- **Transparency Focus**: Under pressure to justify socio-environmental expenses to both Paraguayan and Brazilian press.
