## COMPANY OVERVIEW

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Company Name** | ESSAP S.A. |
| **Headquarters** | Asunción, Paraguay |
| **Industry** | Utilities / Water & Sanitation |
| **Service Area** | Asunción and major urban centers |
| **Key Challenge** | Service interruptions due to low river levels & broken pipes |
| **New Initiative** | "Mi ESSAP" App and Web Portal (May 2024) |

---

## WHY IDEAL PROSPECT

- **Infrastructure Crisis**: Aging pipes lead to constant street leaks ("caños rotos"), visible to everyone.
- **River Level Dependency**: Droughts cause supply cuts, triggering immediate social outcry.
- **Delinquency Crackdown**: Recent aggressive cuts for unpaid bills (Oct 2024) created a spike in negative sentiment.
- **Digital Transition**: Just launched a new app/portal, meaning they are in a "tool adoption" phase.

## SERVICE FIT

| Service | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Comment Analyzer** | 5/5 | Essential to geo-locate reports of broken pipes from social media photos/posts. |
| **Training** | 2/5 | Less critical than operational monitoring. |

**Service Category:** Comment Analyzer Primary

---

## PAIN POINTS

1.  **Geo-locating Leaks**: Users post photos of water leaks on Twitter/Facebook, but ESSAP often misses them or can't locate them.
2.  **Service Cut Communication**: Explaining *why* water is cut (drought vs. broken pump) to angry neighborhoods.
3.  **Billing Anger**: Managing the backlash from the recent "corte por morosidad" campaign.
4.  **Turbid Water**: Complaints about water quality (brown water) need immediate flagging.
