# The Ai-Whisperers Sales Method

## Philosophy: Teach → Tailor → Take Control

## Phase 1: Opening (5 min)
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. Before we dive in, I want to set expectations—this isn't a sales pitch. My goal is to understand your situation and give you honest advice, whether you work with us or not. Sound good?"

## Phase 2: Discovery - Current State (15 min)
### Literal Facts:
- "Walk me through your typical day—what takes the most time?"
- "What tools are you currently using?"
- "How many people are involved in [process]?"

### Impact Questions:
- "When [problem] happens, what does that cost you?"
- "How does this affect your team's morale?"

### Root Cause:
- "Why do you think this hasn't been fixed yet?"
- "What have you tried before?"

## Phase 3: Teaching Moment (5 min)
"Here's what we're seeing across companies like yours..."
[Share insight about automation opportunity]

## Phase 4: Future State (5 min)
"Imagine it's 90 days from now and this problem is solved. What does that look like?"

## Phase 5: Objection Handling
Use Voss techniques:
- Labeling: "It sounds like you're concerned about..."
- Calibrated questions: "How would you handle...?"
- Accusation audit: "You probably think we're just another consultant..."
