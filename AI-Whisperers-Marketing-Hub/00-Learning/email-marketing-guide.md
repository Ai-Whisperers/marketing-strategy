## Email Marketing Benchmarks 2025

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Reported Average | Real Average (MPP-adjusted) | Our Target |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| Open Rate | 42.35% | **20-25%** | 25%+ |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR) | 2.0% | 2.0% | 3%+ |
| Click-to-Open Rate | 5.63% | 5.63% | 8%+ |
| Bounce Rate | 2.48% | 2.48% | < 2% |
| Unsubscribe Rate | 0.08% | 0.08% | < 0.1% |
| B2B Email Open Rate | 39.5% | **20-22%** | 25%+ |

### Why Open Rates Are Misleading

**Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP)** inflates open rates by ~18 points:
- MPP automatically preloads email content (counts as "open")
- Apple Mail = 46% of email clients
- Reported 40% open rate = real 20-25% open rate

**Focus on these instead**:
- Click-through rates (most reliable)
- Reply rates
- Conversion rates
- Revenue attributed to email

### Automated vs. Newsletter Performance

| Email Type | Open Rate | Why Higher |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Automated emails | 51.05% | Triggered, relevant |

## Subject Line Formulas

### High-Performing Formulas

| Formula | Example | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Question | "Losing 15 hrs/week to manual work?" | Cold outreach |
| Personalized | "[Company] + automation = ?" | Cold outreach |
| Curiosity | "What I noticed about your process" | Follow-up |
| Benefit | "Save 10 hours this week" | Value offer |
| Social proof | "How [Similar Company] automated [X]" | Nurture |
| Direct | "Following up on our conversation" | Post-meeting |
| FOMO | "Quick question before I close your file" | Breakup |

### Subject Line Best Practices

| Practice | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Length | 6-10 words (30-50 characters) |
| Personalization | Use name or company when possible |
| Emojis | Use sparingly (1 max, test first) |
| ALL CAPS | Avoid - looks spammy |
| Preview text | Write it intentionally |
| Numbers | Include when relevant |

### A/B Testing Ideas

Test these variables:
- Question vs. statement
- With vs. without first name
- Short (3 words) vs. medium (6-8 words)
- Benefit-focused vs. curiosity-driven
- With vs. without emoji

## Email Content Best Practices

### The 10-Second Rule

People spend **10 seconds** reading brand emails. Optimize for:
- Scannable format (bullets, short paragraphs)
- Clear hierarchy (most important first)
- Single focused message
- One clear CTA

### Structure Template

```
OPENING (1 sentence)
- Hook or personalized reference

BODY (2-4 short sentences)
- Main value or message
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences

CTA (1 sentence)
- Clear, specific next step
- Only ONE primary CTA

SIGN-OFF
- Short, friendly
- Include P.S. for key point
```

### What to Include

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Personalization | Name, company, specific situation |
| Value | What's in it for them |
| Proof | Numbers, results, case studies |
| CTA | Specific, low-friction action |
| P.S. line | Secondary point, often most read |

### What to Avoid

- Long paragraphs
- Multiple competing CTAs
- Generic, non-personalized content
- Attachments (use links instead)
- Aggressive sales language
- Spelling/grammar errors

### CTA Best Practices

**Good CTAs**:
- "Reply with a good time to chat"
- "Book 15 minutes here: [link]"
- "Check out this 2-minute video"
- "Let me know your thoughts"

**Bad CTAs**:
- "Click here to learn more"
- "Schedule a demo" (too salesy)
- Multiple options in one email
