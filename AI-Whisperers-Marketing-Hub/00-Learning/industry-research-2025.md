### Why This Matters for Ai-Whisperers

```
The market is exploding, but most SMEs don't know where to start.
They see the headlines, they know they "should" be using AI, but:
- Enterprise solutions are too expensive
- DIY is too complex
- Freelancers are too risky

We fill that exact gap: Enterprise-quality results at SME-friendly prices.

## Pricing Psychology

### Three-Tier Pricing (The Goldilocks Effect)

```
Research shows 3-tier pricing:
- Increases average deal size by 40-60%
- 60% of buyers choose the middle option
- Creates natural anchoring

Our Structure:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STARTER        │ PROFESSIONAL   │ ENTERPRISE │
│ $2,500-$5,000  │ $5,000-$10,000 │ $10,000+   │
│                │ ← ANCHOR HERE  │            │
│ Basic scope    │ Full solution  │ Complex    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Anchoring Strategies

| Technique | How to Apply |
|-----------|--------------|
| High anchor first | "Enterprise solutions cost $50K+. Our approach delivers similar results for $5K" |
| Show full value | "This normally takes 200 hours. At your rate, that's $20,000 of your time" |
| Price per outcome | "That's $5,000 to save 10 hours/week for the next 5 years" |
| Daily cost | "$5,000 over 12 months is $13.70/day" |

### Value-Based Pricing Principles

1. **Price on value, not time**
   - Don't quote hourly rates
   - Quote project outcomes
   - Tie price to ROI

2. **The 10x Rule**
   - Client should get 10x return on investment
   - $5,000 project → $50,000 in value over time
   - Makes price feel small relative to outcome

3. **Payment Terms That Work**
   - 50% upfront, 50% on completion (standard)
   - Monthly payments for larger projects
   - Results-based bonuses for aligned incentives

### Price Objection Statistics

| Objection Type | Frequency | Real Meaning |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| "Too expensive" | 40% | Haven't seen the value yet |
| "Need to think about it" | 30% | Need more information |
| "Can we do it for less?" | 20% | Testing your flexibility |
| "Not in budget" | 10% | Timing or priority issue |
