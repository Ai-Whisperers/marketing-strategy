## Market Opportunity (Opening Stats)

The SME segment? Growing even faster at 32%.

Most businesses know they should be using AI.
They just don't know where to start."

## Our Differentiator (The Killer Stat)

"Did you know that 80-85% of AI projects FAIL?

They fail because of:

• Wrong-sized solutions
• No support after launch

We've flipped those odds:

• With us: 60-75%

We're not selling AI. We're selling certainty."

## Objection Responses

### "It's too expensive"

```
"I understand. Let me ask you this:

How much is [problem] costing you right now?
Every hour spent on repetitive tasks is an
hour not spent on growth.

We offer flexible pricing: $50/hr for web design,
$80/hr for microservices, $100 per consulting session.

The real question: Can you afford NOT to do this?"
```

### "We'll do it ourselves"

```
"Many people try that route. Here's what happens:

80% of DIY AI projects never reach production.
Course completion rate? Under 15%.
Time to learn + implement? 100+ hours.

We've done this before. We get it right the first time.
It will work. And it won't take forever."
```

### "Not the right time"

```
"I hear that a lot. Can I share something?

Every week you wait, you're losing [X hours × $Y].
That's $[amount] in productivity left on the table.

The best time was yesterday.
The second best time is now.

What would need to change to make this the right time?"
```

### "I need to think about it"

```
"Completely understand. What specifically are you weighing?

Is it the investment? The timing? Something else?

[Listen, then address specific concern]

What would you need to see to feel confident moving forward?"
```
