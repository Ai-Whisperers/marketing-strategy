> - The exact tools to use
> - And the time you'll save

> Let's dive in.

### TASK 1: Meeting Scheduling (1:15 - 3:00)

**The Problem**:
> "What times work for you?"
> "How about Tuesday at 2?"
> "That doesn't work, what about Wednesday?"
> "I'm in meetings all Wednesday, Thursday?"

> Sound familiar? This email ping-pong wastes hours every week. It's insane that people still do this manually.

**The Automation**:
> Set up a scheduling tool like Calendly, SavvyCal, or Cal.com.

> Here's what happens:
> 1. You share your booking link
> 2. They see your actual availability
> 3. They pick a time
> 4. Both calendars update automatically
> 5. Reminders go out automatically

> No back and forth. No double bookings. No "I forgot we had a meeting."

**How to Set It Up**:
> - Sign up for Calendly (free tier works great)
> - Connect your calendar
> - Set your availability preferences
> - Add buffer time between meetings
> - Customize your booking page
> Done in 10-15 minutes.

**Time Saved**: 2-4 hours per week
**Setup Time**: 10 minutes
**Cost**: Free - $12/month

**Pro Tip**:
> Add a question asking what they want to discuss. Now you're prepared for every meeting before it starts.

---

### TASK 2: Email Follow-Ups (3:00 - 5:00)

**The Problem**:
> How many times have you meant to follow up with someone and just... forgot? Or you followed up once, they didn't respond, and you let it drop?

> Studies show it takes 5-7 touches to convert a prospect. Most people give up after one.

**The Automation**:
> Set up automated follow-up sequences. When you send an important email, automatically send follow-ups until they respond.

**How to Set It Up**:
> Option 1: Gmail + Streak or Boomerang
> - Write your initial email
> - Set follow-ups to send if no reply
> - 3-5 emails over 2 weeks

> Option 2: Dedicated tool like Lemlist, Mailshake, or Apollo
> - More powerful
> - Better tracking
> - Good for sales outreach

**Example Sequence**:
> Day 0: Initial email
> Day 3: "Just floating this back up..."
> Day 7: "One more try - here's why this matters..."
> Day 14: "Last attempt - closing this loop..."

**Time Saved**: 3-5 hours per week
**Setup Time**: 30 minutes
**Cost**: $0-50/month

**Pro Tip**:
> Personalize the first email heavily. The follow-ups can be shorter - they're just reminders.

---

### TASK 3: Social Media Scheduling (5:00 - 7:00)

**The Problem**:
> Posting consistently on social media is crucial for visibility. But logging in every day, crafting a post, finding an image, hitting publish - it's a time suck that breaks your flow.

**The Automation**:
> Batch create your content, then schedule it to post automatically throughout the week.

**How to Set It Up**:
> Tools: Buffer (easiest), Hootsuite, Later, or native scheduling

> The process:
> 1. Block 1-2 hours once a week for content creation
> 2. Write 5-7 posts for the week
> 3. Add images or create graphics
> 4. Schedule for optimal times
> 5. Forget about it until next week

**Best Practices**:
> - Monday: Schedule the whole week
> - Use a content calendar template
> - Repurpose existing content (blog → multiple posts)
> - Save your best-performing posts to recycle

**Time Saved**: 3-5 hours per week
**Setup Time**: 15 minutes for tool setup, then ongoing batching
**Cost**: Free - $15/month

**Pro Tip**:
> Don't just schedule and forget. Spend 15 minutes daily ENGAGING with comments and others' posts. The scheduling saves time for content creation - reinvest some of that in engagement.

---

### TASK 4: Invoice & Payment Reminders (7:00 - 9:00)

**The Problem**:
> Chasing payments is awkward, time-consuming, and affects cash flow. Most small businesses lose money simply because they're too busy (or uncomfortable) to follow up on unpaid invoices.

**The Automation**:
> Set up automatic invoice creation and payment reminders.

**How to Set It Up**:
> Tools: QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Wave (free), or Stripe invoicing

> Automate:
> 1. Invoice creation from project templates
> 2. Automatic delivery when work is done
> 3. Payment reminders before due date
> 4. Overdue notices (with escalating urgency)
> 5. Thank you emails when paid

**Example Reminder Sequence**:
> - 3 days before due: "Friendly reminder, invoice due soon"
> - Due date: "Invoice is due today"
> - 3 days overdue: "This invoice is now overdue"
> - 7 days overdue: "Please prioritize payment"
> - 14 days overdue: "Final notice before we escalate"

**Time Saved**: 2-3 hours per month
**Setup Time**: 30 minutes
**Cost**: Usually included in accounting software

**The Real Win**:
> This isn't just about time. It's about getting paid faster. Automated reminders can improve collection rates by 30-50%. That's real money in your pocket.

**Pro Tip**:
> Offer multiple payment methods. The easier you make it to pay, the faster people pay.

### TASK 5: Customer Onboarding (9:00 - 11:00)

**The Problem**:
> New customer signs up. Now you have to:
> - Send welcome email
> - Share login credentials
> - Provide getting started guide
> - Schedule kickoff call
> - Add them to your systems
> - Send contract/agreement

> Do this manually and you'll miss steps. Or worse, you'll spend so much time onboarding that you can't handle more customers.

**The Automation**:
> Create an automated onboarding sequence that triggers when someone becomes a customer.

**How to Set It Up**:
> Tools: Zapier, Make, or your CRM's built-in automation

> When new customer is added:
> 1. Trigger welcome email series
> 2. Create accounts in your tools
> 3. Share access credentials securely
> 4. Send onboarding documents/videos
> 5. Create task for personal outreach
> 6. Schedule kickoff meeting

**Example Onboarding Sequence**:
> Immediate: Welcome email + what to expect
> Day 1: Access credentials + getting started guide
> Day 2: "How to get the most out of working with us"
> Day 3: Schedule kickoff call (Calendly link)
> Day 5: Check-in - "Any questions so far?"
> Day 7: Kickoff call reminder

**Time Saved**: 2-4 hours per new customer
**Setup Time**: 1-2 hours
**Cost**: Depends on tools (can be free with basic setup)

**The Real Win**:
> Consistent onboarding = happier customers = better retention = more referrals. This automation doesn't just save time, it makes you look professional.

**Pro Tip**:
> Record video walkthroughs once. Embed them in your onboarding emails. Customers can watch at their pace, and you never explain the same thing twice.
