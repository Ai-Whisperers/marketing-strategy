### SECTION 1: What is AI Automation? (1:30 - 3:30)

**Key Point**:
> Let's start simple. AI automation is using artificial intelligence to do tasks that used to require a human.

**The Old Way vs The New Way**:
> Think about how you handle a common business task - let's say customer emails.

> **Old way**: Email comes in. You read it. You think about the answer. You type a response. Maybe you copy-paste from a template. You hit send. Repeat 50 times a day.

> **AI Automation way**: Email comes in. AI reads it, understands what the customer needs, drafts a personalized response based on your style and your knowledge base, and either sends it automatically OR puts it in your inbox for a quick review. You just approve and move on.

**The Key Distinction**:
> This isn't just "automation" like setting up an out-of-office reply. The AI actually UNDERSTANDS the content. It can handle variations. It learns your preferences. It does what a human would do, just faster and without getting tired.

**Simple Definition**:
> AI automation = Teaching a computer to do knowledge work that used to require human judgment.

**B-Roll**: Show email inbox, then show automated workflow diagram

### SECTION 2: The 5 Types of Tasks AI Can Automate (3:30 - 5:30)

**Transition**:
> So what can AI actually automate? I break it down into 5 categories.

**Type 1: Communication**
> Emails, customer support, follow-ups, scheduling. Anything where you're typing the same kinds of messages over and over.
>
> Example: A law firm I worked with automated 70% of their initial client inquiries. Same quality responses, zero lawyer time required.

**Type 2: Document Creation**
> Reports, proposals, invoices, contracts. Documents that follow patterns.
>
> Example: An operations manager who spent 4 hours every week creating status reports. Now it takes 10 minutes to review what AI generates.

**Type 3: Data Processing**
> Entering data, cleaning data, analyzing data, creating summaries.
>
> Example: An e-commerce company that manually categorized customer feedback. Now AI reads thousands of comments and tells them exactly what customers are complaining about.

**Type 4: Research & Analysis**
> Competitor research, market analysis, content research.
>
> Example: A marketing team that spent 5 hours researching each blog post. Now AI does the initial research in 5 minutes.

**Type 5: Workflow Coordination**
> Connecting different tools, triggering actions, moving information between systems.
>
> Example: When a new lead fills out a form, AI automatically enriches their data, scores them, creates a task for sales, and sends a personalized welcome email. All without anyone lifting a finger.

**Key Insight**:
> Notice what these have in common? They're all REPETITIVE. They follow PATTERNS. They're IMPORTANT but not CREATIVE.

> That's the sweet spot for AI automation.

**B-Roll**: Quick examples of each type on screen

### SECTION 3: Real Business Examples (5:30 - 7:00)

**Transition**:
> Let me show you what this looks like in the real world.

**Example 1: Solo Consultant**
> Sarah is a marketing consultant. She was spending 8 hours a week on admin: scheduling calls, sending follow-ups, creating proposals.
>
> We automated:
> - Calendar booking (Calendly + AI confirmation)
> - Follow-up emails (automated sequences)
> - Proposal first drafts (AI generates from brief)
>
> Result: 6 hours per week recovered. That's basically a full workday she now spends on billable client work.

**Example 2: Small Business**
> A 15-person hospitality supplier. Orders came in by email, phone, WhatsApp. Chaos.
>
> We automated:
> - Order capture (all channels → one system)
> - Quote generation (AI creates quotes in minutes)
> - Customer updates (automatic status notifications)
>
> Result: Quote time dropped from 24 hours to 2 hours. They started winning deals they used to lose to faster competitors.

**Example 3: Growing Company**
> A 50-person SaaS company drowning in customer feedback across reviews, support tickets, and social media.
>
> We automated:
> - Feedback collection (scraped from 12 sources)
> - Sentiment analysis (AI categorizes and scores)
> - Insight reports (weekly AI-generated summary)
>
> Result: Product team finally knew what customers actually wanted. Feature prioritization became data-driven instead of guesswork.

### SECTION 4: Finding Your Opportunities (7:00 - 8:30)

**Transition**:
> So how do you find YOUR automation opportunities?

**The Time Audit**:
> Here's a simple exercise. For one week, write down every task that:
> 1. You do repeatedly (same type of task, different inputs)
> 2. Follows a pattern (if X happens, do Y)
> 3. Doesn't require your unique creativity or judgment

**The Questions to Ask**:
> For each task, ask:
> - "Could I write instructions for someone else to do this?"
> - "Do I basically do the same thing each time?"
> - "Is this task important but not the best use of my time?"

> If you answered yes to all three - that's an automation candidate.

**The Low-Hanging Fruit**:
> Start with these. They're almost always worth automating:
> - Meeting scheduling
> - Email follow-ups
> - Data entry from forms
> - Report generation
> - Customer FAQ responses

**The Audit Tool**:
> I've created a free tool that walks you through this process step by step. It's called the AI Automation Opportunity Audit. 15 minutes, and you'll know exactly where your hidden hours are.
>
> Link's in the description.

### SUMMARY (8:30 - 9:00)

**Recap**:
> So, to recap:
> - AI automation is using AI to handle knowledge work that used to require humans
> - It's best for repetitive, pattern-based, important-but-not-creative tasks
> - Real businesses are saving significant time every week
> - You can find your opportunities with a simple time audit

**Key Takeaway**:
> The question isn't whether AI automation will affect your business. It's whether you'll use it to get ahead, or let your competitors do it first.
