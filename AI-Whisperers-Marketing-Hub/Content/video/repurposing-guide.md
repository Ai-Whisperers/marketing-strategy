> 1 video → 20+ pieces of content

## Why Repurpose?

Creating one good video takes hours. That same content can fuel your marketing for weeks across every platform - if you have a system.

**The Math**:
- 1 video = 4 hours of work
- Repurposed content = 1 hour additional
- Total output = 20+ pieces of content
- ROI per hour: 5x improvement
