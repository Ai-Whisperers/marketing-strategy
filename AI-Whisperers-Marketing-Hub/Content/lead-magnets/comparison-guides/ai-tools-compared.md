## My Honest Recommendation

**For most small businesses**: Start with ChatGPT Plus.

It's not always the best at any single thing, but it's good at everything. The ecosystem of custom GPTs and plugins adds huge value. And when you tell people "I use AI," they'll know what you mean.

**If you're writing-heavy**: Add Claude Pro.

The writing quality difference is noticeable. For blog posts, emails, and anything that needs to sound human, Claude is worth the extra $20/month.

**If you're budget-conscious**: Use the free tiers strategically.

Free ChatGPT for quick tasks. Free Claude for writing. Free Perplexity for research. You can get 80% of the value for $0.

## What About Automation?

These AI assistants are great, but the real power comes from **connecting them to your workflows**.

That's where automation platforms come in:

| Platform | Best For | Pricing |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Zapier** | Beginners, wide integrations | Free - $19.99+/mo |
| **Make** | Visual workflows, power users | Free - $9+/mo |
| **n8n** | Developers, self-hosting | Free (self-host) - $20+/mo |

A simple automation example:
1. Customer fills out form →
2. AI analyzes their needs →
3. Personalized response sent automatically

This is where AI goes from "cool" to "business-changing."
