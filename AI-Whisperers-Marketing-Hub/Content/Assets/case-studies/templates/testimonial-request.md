### Initial Request - Casual

```
Subject: Quick favor?

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well!

I wanted to ask - would you be open to sharing a quick testimonial
about our work together? Just a few sentences about your experience
and results.

It would really help other [industry] companies see what's possible.

If you're up for it, I can either:
1. Send you a few questions to answer in writing
2. Hop on a 10-minute call and I'll write it up for you

Either way works! Let me know.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### Initial Request - Formal

```
Subject: Would you share your experience?

Dear [Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As we wrap up our project together, I wanted to reach out about
something that would be tremendously helpful for Ai-Whisperers.

Would you be willing to provide a testimonial about your experience
working with us? Your perspective on the results we achieved would
be invaluable for other companies considering AI automation.

The testimonial could be as simple as 2-3 sentences, and I'd be
happy to draft something based on our conversations for your
approval if that's easier.

Please let me know if you'd be comfortable with this.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

### Follow-Up (If No Response)

```
Subject: Re: Quick favor?

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up - totally understand if you're swamped!

If a testimonial feels like too much, even a one-liner about your
experience would be super helpful. Something like:

"[Result we achieved] - would recommend Ai-Whisperers."

No pressure at all either way.

## Question Prompts

Send these if the client prefers to write their own:

### Option 1: Simple (3 questions)

```
Thanks for agreeing to this! Here are a few questions -
feel free to answer in whatever detail feels natural:

1. What was your biggest challenge before we worked together?

2. What results have you seen since implementing our solution?

3. Would you recommend Ai-Whisperers to others? Why?

Just hit reply with your answers and I'll format it nicely.
```

### Option 2: Detailed (For comprehensive testimonials)

```
Thanks so much! Here are some questions to guide your testimonial.
Answer whichever ones resonate - you don't need to do all of them.

BEFORE:
- What was happening in your business before we started?
- What had you tried that didn't work?

DURING:
- What was it like working with us?
- What surprised you about the process?

AFTER:
- What specific results have you seen?
- What's different now compared to before?

RECOMMENDATION:
- What would you tell someone considering working with us?
- Who would you recommend us to?

Feel free to be as brief or detailed as you'd like!
```

## Phone/Video Script

For a quick call to capture the testimonial:

### Questions

1. **Context**: "Can you give me a quick background on your company and your role?"

2. **Before**: "What was going on that made you look for help with AI automation?"

3. **Why Us**: "What made you decide to work with Ai-Whisperers specifically?"

4. **Experience**: "What was it like working with us?"

5. **Results**: "What results have you seen? Can you put some numbers on it?"

6. **Recommendation**: "What would you tell someone who's considering this?"

## LinkedIn Recommendation Request

```
Hi [Name],

Would you be open to leaving a LinkedIn recommendation about our
work together? It would really help build credibility for
Ai-Whisperers.

Here's a direct link to leave one: [LinkedIn recommendation link]

If you'd like, I can send some bullet points to make it easier -
just let me know.

Thanks so much!

## Video Testimonial Request

```
Subject: Quick video testimonial?

Hi [Name],

This is a bigger ask, but I wanted to see if you'd be open to
recording a short video testimonial (2-3 minutes).

You wouldn't need any fancy equipment - your phone or laptop
webcam works great. I'd send you a few questions to answer,
and you'd just record yourself responding naturally.

Video testimonials are incredibly powerful for helping others
see what's possible, and yours would be amazing given the
results you've achieved.

Totally understand if it's not your thing - a written
testimonial works great too.

Let me know your thoughts!
[Your name]
```

### Video Question Guide (if they agree)

```
Here are the questions for your video. Just answer naturally -
it doesn't need to be perfect!

1. Introduce yourself (name, company, role) - 15 sec

2. What challenge were you facing before? - 30 sec

3. What results have you seen? - 45 sec

4. What would you tell someone considering Ai-Whisperers? - 30 sec

Tips:
- Find a quiet spot with good lighting (facing a window is great)
- Look at the camera, not the screen
- It's okay to pause and restart - we can edit
- Be yourself!

Send me the file when you're done and I'll take care of the rest.
```

Thanks again,

## Tips for Great Testimonials

### Do:
- Ask soon after project completion (while results are fresh)
- Make it easy (offer to write a draft for approval)
- Ask specific questions (not "what did you think?")
- Request specific numbers and results
- Follow up once if no response

### Don't:
- Ask for "a testimonial" with no guidance
- Use without explicit permission
- Edit to change meaning
- Wait too long after the project
- Be pushy if they decline
