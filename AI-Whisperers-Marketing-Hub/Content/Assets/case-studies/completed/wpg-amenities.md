## The Challenge

### Background
As WPG Amenities grew, their manual processes couldn't keep up. What worked when they had 20 hotel clients became a bottleneck at 100+ clients.

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Slow Quote Turnaround**: Custom quotes required manually looking up pricing, calculating quantities, and formatting documents - taking 24-48 hours per request.

2. **Order Management Chaos**: Orders came in via email, phone, and WhatsApp. Tracking and fulfilling them consistently was a constant challenge.

3. **Inventory Visibility**: No real-time view of inventory levels meant frequent stockouts and emergency orders to suppliers.

4. **Customer Communication**: Keeping customers updated on order status required manual emails and calls.

### What They Had Tried Before
- Spreadsheets for inventory (quickly outdated)
- Email folders for order management (things got lost)
- Part-time admin help (helped, but didn't solve root cause)

### The Breaking Point
[Specific incident that made them seek help - lost order, angry customer, missed opportunity, etc.]
