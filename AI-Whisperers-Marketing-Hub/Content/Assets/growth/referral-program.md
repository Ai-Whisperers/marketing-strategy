## How to Ask for Referrals

### Timing (When to Ask)

**Best moments**:
1. After delivering exceptional results
2. When client gives positive feedback
3. At project completion
4. During quarterly check-ins
5. When they mention knowing someone who could use help

**Never ask**:
- During onboarding (too early)
- When there are unresolved issues
- Randomly without context

```
Subject: Quick thank you - and a question

Hi [Name],

So glad to hear [specific positive result they mentioned].

Quick question - do you know anyone else who's dealing with similar challenges around [their pain point]? Happy to offer them a free strategy session.

And as a thank you, we offer a $500 service credit for successful referrals.

No pressure at all - just thought I'd mention it.

**Template 2: Project Completion**
```
Subject: Wrapping up - one last thing

Hi [Name],

With the project complete, I wanted to say thanks for being such a great client to work with.

One thing that would mean a lot: if you know any other [industry] businesses struggling with [pain point], I'd love an introduction. I'll take great care of them, and we offer a $500 credit for your next project as a thank you.

Either way, it's been a pleasure. Let's stay in touch.

[Your name]

**Template 3: Direct Ask**

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Who in your network is complaining about [specific pain point]?

We're looking to work with more [type of company] like yours, and referrals from great clients are how we find our best fits.

If anyone comes to mind, I'd love an intro. I'll make sure they're taken care of, and there's a $500 credit for you when they sign on.

**If they mention knowing someone**:

> "That's great! Would you be comfortable making an introduction via email? Just cc me and say something like 'You should talk to [your name] about [topic].' I'll take it from there. And as a thanks, we have a $500 referral credit for you when they become a client."
