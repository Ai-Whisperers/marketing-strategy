# Hero Section Update

## Current Hero Section (ai-whisperers.org)

```
Whisper AI into Action

Enterprise-grade AI solutions that save you time, money, and energy.

[See Projects] [Get in Touch]
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ "Whisper AI into Action" - Clever but unclear
- ❌ "Save time, money, energy" - Generic, every consultant says this
- ❌ No differentiation or unique value
- ❌ No lead capture CTA
- ❌ Missing your biggest advantage (GitHub proof)
