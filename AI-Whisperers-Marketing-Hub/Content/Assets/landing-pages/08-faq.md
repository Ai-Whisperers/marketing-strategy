## 20 Essential Questions & Answers

### CATEGORY: GENERAL

**Q1: What exactly does AI Whisperers do?**

A: We help businesses automate their operations using AI and no-code/low-code tools. We offer three options: DIY courses for those who want to learn, done-with-you consulting for teams building capabilities, and done-for-you implementation for busy leaders who want results fast. Whether it's automating your email follow-ups, CRM updates, reporting, or entire departments, we handle it end-to-end.

---

**Q2: How is this different from hiring a traditional consultant?**

A: Traditional consultants create strategy decks and leave. We build, implement, and show our work. Our GitHub is public—you can see the code we write. We focus on results (time saved, costs reduced) not just advice. And we work fast: most implementations complete in 2-4 weeks, not 6-12 months.

---

**Q3: Do you work with companies in my industry?**

A: We've worked across 15+ industries including SaaS, e-commerce, consulting, agencies, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Most business processes (email, data entry, reporting, CRM management) are similar across industries. We customize our approach to your specific workflows, regardless of industry.

---

### CATEGORY: PRICING & ROI

**Q4: How much does it cost?**

A: It depends on what you need:
- **DIY Courses**: $497-$2,997 (learn yourself)
- **Done-With-You Consulting**: $5K-$15K (we guide, you build)
- **Done-For-You Implementation**: $8.5K-$50K+ (we build everything)

Most clients start with a Quick Wins package ($5K-8.5K) to prove ROI, then expand. Book a free strategy call for a custom quote.

---

**Q5: What's the typical ROI?**

A: Our clients average:
- **40% reduction in operational costs**
- **10-20 hours saved per week per person**
- **Payback period**: 2-4 months typically
- **5-year value**: 10-20x the initial investment

We track and report on ROI throughout the project. If you don't see measurable results within 90 days, we keep working until you do (at no extra cost).

---

**Q6: Do you offer payment plans?**

A: Yes, for projects $15K+. We typically offer 3-month payment terms. For example, a $30K project can be split into 3 payments of $10K. Terms are discussed during contract negotiation.

---

**Q7: Is there a minimum project size?**

A: Our smallest package is the Quick Wins at $5K (or $497 for DIY courses). If you're not ready for that investment, we recommend starting with our free AI Automation Opportunity Audit to understand your potential ROI first.

---

### CATEGORY: PROCESS & TIMELINE

**Q8: How long does implementation take?**

A: Typical timelines:
- **Quick Wins** (1-3 automations): 2 weeks
- **Department Automation** (5-10 automations): 4-6 weeks
- **Company-Wide** (unlimited automations): 8-12 weeks

We work fast because we use proven frameworks and no-code/low-code tools. Most of our competitors take 3-6x longer.

---

**Q9: What's the process?**

A: Four phases:

**Week 1 - Discovery**: We map your processes, identify opportunities, create a roadmap. Your involvement: 2-3 hours of interviews.

**Week 2-3 - Build**: We configure tools, build workflows, test everything. Your involvement: Weekly 30-min check-ins.

**Week 4 - Launch**: We train your team, deploy to production, monitor closely. Your involvement: 1-2 hours of training.

**Ongoing - Support**: 90 days of included support, monthly check-ins, optimization.

See our "How We Work" page for full details.

---

**Q10: How much time do we need to invest?**

A: It depends on the service:
- **DIY Courses**: 30-90 days of self-paced learning
- **Done-With-You**: 10-20 hours/week during implementation
- **Done-For-You**: 5-10 hours total (mostly for interviews and training)

Done-for-you is designed for busy leaders who don't have time to manage projects.

---

**Q11: Can you work with our existing tools?**

A: Yes! We integrate with 1,000+ tools including:
- **CRMs**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho
- **Email**: Gmail, Outlook, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign
- **Project Management**: Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Jira
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, Discord
- **Data**: Google Sheets, Airtable, Excel, PostgreSQL
- **And many more...**

If you have a custom or less common tool, we can usually build an API integration.

---

### CATEGORY: TECHNICAL

**Q12: Do we need technical skills or developers on our team?**

A: No! That's the point. We use no-code and low-code tools so your non-technical team can use (and even modify) the automations. During training, we show your team how everything works—no programming required.

That said, if you have developers, they can access the code and customize further. It's flexible.

---

**Q13: What if something breaks?**

A: All implementations include 90 days of support. If something breaks or needs adjustment, we fix it (usually within 24-48 hours). After the support period, we offer monthly retainer plans for ongoing maintenance and optimization.

We also document everything thoroughly and train your team, so many simple issues can be handled in-house.

---

**Q14: Is our data secure?**

A: Yes. We follow security best practices:
- All data connections use secure APIs and OAuth
- No sensitive data is stored unnecessarily
- We sign NDAs upon request
- We're happy to work within your security requirements
- For regulated industries (healthcare, finance), we ensure compliance

We can provide detailed security documentation during the sales process.

---

**Q15: What tools/platforms do you use?**

A: We're tool-agnostic and choose based on your needs, but common tools include:
- **Automation platforms**: Make.com, Zapier, n8n
- **AI**: ChatGPT/OpenAI, Claude, custom models
- **Integration**: Custom APIs, webhooks
- **No-code**: Airtable, Notion, Webflow
- **Code**: Python, TypeScript, Node.js when needed

We use the best tool for the job, not whatever we happen to know.

---

### CATEGORY: GETTING STARTED

**Q16: How do we get started?**

A: Three simple steps:

1. **Book a free strategy call** (30 minutes)—we discuss your challenges and goals
2. **Receive custom proposal** (48 hours)—detailed plan with timeline and pricing
3. **Kick off if it's a fit**—we start working within 1-2 weeks

No pressure, no obligation. If automation isn't right for you, we'll tell you.

---

**Q17: What should we prepare for the first call?**

A: Come ready to discuss:
- Your biggest operational challenges
- Current processes that waste time
- Tools you currently use
- Team size and structure
- Budget range (if you have one)
- Timeline expectations

Don't worry about having everything figured out—we'll help you identify opportunities.

---

**Q18: Can we start with a pilot project?**

A: Absolutely! Most clients start with a Quick Wins package—we automate 1-3 high-impact processes to prove ROI. If it works well (it usually does), we expand from there.

Starting small reduces risk and builds confidence before making a larger investment.

---

**Q19: Do you provide training?**

A: Yes! Training is included in all packages:
- **DIY Courses**: Self-paced video training + weekly Q&A
- **Done-With-You**: Coaching sessions throughout + documentation
- **Done-For-You**: 1-2 day comprehensive training for your team + SOPs

We don't just build and leave—we ensure your team knows how to use and maintain everything.

---

### CATEGORY: RESULTS & GUARANTEES

**Q20: What if it doesn't work or we're not happy?**

A: We have a results guarantee: If you don't see measurable ROI within 90 days, we'll continue optimizing your automations at no additional cost until you do.

We've done this 50+ times. We know it works. If something isn't performing, we fix it.

For courses, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee—no questions asked.
