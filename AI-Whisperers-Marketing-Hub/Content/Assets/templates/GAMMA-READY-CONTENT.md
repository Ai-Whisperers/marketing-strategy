# Ai-Whisperers: If You Have to Do It More Than Once, Automate It

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

Your team spends hours every week on repetitive tasks that AI could handle in minutes.

Every repetitive task is a problem waiting to be automated.

And every week you wait, you're falling further behind competitors who've already automated.

---

## The Industry's Dirty Secret

80-85% of AI projects fail to reach production.

Why? Because most approaches are:
- Too complex for SMEs
- Too expensive (enterprise pricing)
- No support after launch
- Unrealistic timelines

---

## We've Flipped Those Odds

| Approach | Success Rate | Timeline |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| DIY/Courses | 15-33% | 6-18 months |
| Freelancers | 30-50% | Variable |
| Enterprise firms | 60-70% | 6-12 months |
| **Professional help** | **60-75%** | **Fast** |

---

## The Market Opportunity

The AI automation market is exploding:
- 2024: $233 billion
- 2032: $1.7 trillion (projected)
- Growth rate: 29.2% annually

SMEs are the fastest-growing segment at 32.1% CAGR.

The question isn't IF you'll automate. It's WHEN.

# PRESENTATION 5: Webinar Slides Framework

```
# From Manual to Automated: A Practical Guide for SMEs

## Welcome!

Today you'll learn:
- Why 80% of AI projects fail (and how to be in the 20%)
- The real ROI of automation (with numbers)
- How to identify your biggest opportunities
- A simple framework to get started

Let's dive in.

---

## The State of AI Automation in 2025

Market size: $233 billion → $1.7 trillion by 2032

SME segment growing 32.1% annually (fastest!)

93% of executives exploring AI agents.

This isn't future talk. This is happening now.

---

## Why Are SMEs Still Manual?

Top reasons businesses haven't automated:
1. "It's too expensive" (enterprise pricing myth)
2. "It's too complex" (wrong solutions)
3. "We'll do it later" (the $47K/year delay)
4. "We tried and failed" (wrong approach)

Sound familiar?

---

## The True Cost of Manual Work

Let's do the math:
- Hours on repetitive tasks: 10-25/week
- Average blended rate: $60/hour
- Annual waste: $31,000 - $78,000

That's 1-2 employees' worth of salary... doing robot work.

---

## What Does Automation Actually Look Like?

Before: Manual data entry, copy-paste, email follow-ups
After: Triggers → Actions → Results (while you sleep)

Examples:
- New lead → CRM → Welcome sequence → Task assignment
- Invoice received → OCR → Approval workflow → Payment
- Appointment booked → Reminders → Follow-up → Feedback

---

## Industry Success Stories

| Industry | What They Automated | Result |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Healthcare | Patient scheduling | 80% less admin time |
| E-commerce | Order processing | 95% error reduction |
| Agencies | Client onboarding | 10 hours/week saved |
| Finance | Report generation | 4 hours → 20 minutes |

---

## The 80% Failure Problem

Why most AI projects fail:
- Unclear objectives (35%)
- Unrealistic expectations (30%)
- No change management (25%)
- Wrong-sized solutions (15%)

It's not the technology. It's the approach.

---

## What Winners Do Differently

Success factors:
- Start small and specific (+45% success)
- Get quick wins first (+40% success)
- Include training and support (+50% retention)
- Define metrics upfront

The secret? Right-sized solutions, not moonshots.

---

## DIY vs Professional: The Real Comparison

| Factor | DIY | Professional |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Success rate | 15-33% | 60-75% |
| Time to value | 6-18 months | 1-3 months |
| Hidden costs | Very high | Included |
| Support | None | 60+ days |

---

## Our Implementation Model

Step 1: Discovery (what to automate)
Step 2: Design (how to automate)
Step 3: Build (make it work)
Step 4: Launch (go live + train)

Then: Ongoing support.

Fast, focused, proven.

---

## How to Identify Your Opportunities

Ask yourself:
1. What tasks do you do every single day?
2. What involves copy-paste between systems?
3. What requires follow-up reminders?
4. What causes the most errors?
5. What would you delegate if you could?

Those are your automation candidates.
