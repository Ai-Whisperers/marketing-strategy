## Why Track Lead Sources?

Not all leads are equal. A lead from a referral might close 50% of the time, while a lead from cold email might close 5%.

Tracking sources helps you:
- Double down on what works
- Stop wasting time on what doesn't
- Calculate true cost per acquisition
- Predict future results
