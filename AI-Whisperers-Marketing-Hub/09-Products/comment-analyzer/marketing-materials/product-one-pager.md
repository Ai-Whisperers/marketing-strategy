# SOCIAL MEDIA INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM - ONE PAGER

## The Problem

Companies receive **thousands of social media comments monthly** but lack the time or tools to analyze them effectively:
- 📊 Customer sentiment buried in unstructured data
- ⏰ Manual analysis takes 30-50 hours per month
- 💸 Expensive tools ($800-2,000/month) with complex setup
- 🌎 Global tools don't understand LATAM context (Spanish/Portuguese slang, cultural nuances)
- ⚠️ Negative comments escalate into crises before anyone notices
