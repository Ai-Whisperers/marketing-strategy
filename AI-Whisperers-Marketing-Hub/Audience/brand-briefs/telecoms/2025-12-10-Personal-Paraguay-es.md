## 1. PAIN POINT DIAGNOSIS (The "Why Now")
*Start here. What is bleeding?*

*   **Primary Pain Point**: **Spam Fatigue & Rural Gaps**. Like Claro, Personal is hammered for spam, but also faces specific complaints about network failure in rural areas ("Interior").
*   **Evidence**:
    *   [Reddit 2025]: "Spam calls and messages", "Network failures in rural areas".
    *   [Market Context]: Personal is fighting a two-front war: Tigo in the city, Starlink in the countryside.
*   **Urgency Trigger**: **New Leadership**. Marcelo Prudencio became GM in Dec 2025. He needs a 100-day plan that differentiates Personal from the "Spammy Telcos".

## 3. DECISION MAKER MAPPING (Rule 14)

| Role | Name | LinkedIn | Notes/Hooks |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Marcelo Prudencio | [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-prudencio) | New GM (Dec 2025). Fresh eyes, looking for a strategic shift. |
| **Technical Buyer** | [Network Ops Director] | *Researching* | Dealing with the "Rural Failure" tickets. |

## 4. SERVICE FIT & ANGLE

*   **Proposed Solution**: **Churn Prediction Model**
*   **Value Proposition**: "Stop spamming everyone. Use AI to predict exactly *when* a rural customer is about to churn to Starlink (based on network dropouts) and offer them a proactive discount."
*   **Deal Potential**: $180K+/year

---

## 5. LOCAL CONTEXT (Rule 17)
*   **"Personal es rápido, pero..."**: The speed branding is strong, but the "customer care" aspect is weak. The spam issue dilutes the premium "Flow" brand.
