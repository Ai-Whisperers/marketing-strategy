## 1. PAIN POINT DIAGNOSIS (The "Why Now")
*Start here. What is bleeding?*

*   **Primary Pain Point**: **Post-Ransomware Trust Crisis & Service Gaps**. Following the massive Jan 2024 attack, business clients are hypersensitive to security and uptime.
*   **Evidence**:
    *   [Ransomware attack impacted 300+ companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tigo-business-paraguay-hit-by-ransomware-attack/)
    *   [Reddit: "Blocked by Tigo WhatsApp support"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Paraguay/comments/1c5x8j2/tigo_me_bloqueo_de_whatsapp/)
*   **Urgency Trigger**: **New Leadership**. Roberto Laratro took over as GM in June 2024, likely looking for "quick wins" to restore confidence.

## 4. SERVICE FIT & ANGLE

*   **Proposed Solution**: **Comment Analyzer (Sentiment Defense)**
*   **Value Proposition**: "Rebuild trust by detecting 'silent churn' signals (e.g., 'switching to Personal') on social media before they call to cancel."
*   **Deal Potential**: $150K+/year (Enterprise License)

---

## 5. LOCAL CONTEXT (Rule 17)
*   **"El que calla otorga"**: In Paraguay, silence after a service failure (like the hack) is seen as arrogance. Tigo needs to be *seen* listening.
*   **Personal vs. Tigo**: Personal is aggressively poaching clients with "Fiber" offers. Tigo needs to defend its "Premium" status.
