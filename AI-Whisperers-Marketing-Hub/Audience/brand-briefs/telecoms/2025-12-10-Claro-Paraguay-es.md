## 1. PAIN POINT DIAGNOSIS (The "Why Now")
*Start here. What is bleeding?*

*   **Primary Pain Point**: **Regulatory & Reputation Risk (Spam)**. Claro was sanctioned by SEDECO (upheld by Supreme Court in 2024) for invasive telemarketing ("No Molestar" violations).
*   **Evidence**:
    *   [Supreme Court Ruling 2024](https://www.tedic.org/corte-suprema-confirma-multa-a-claro/)
    *   [Reddit: "Aversion to Claro's calls"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Paraguay/comments/claro_spam/)
*   **Urgency Trigger**: **Legal Precedent**. The Supreme Court ruling opens the door for massive class-action lawsuits or stricter fines. They need a new way to sell that isn't "spam calling".

## 4. SERVICE FIT & ANGLE

*   **Proposed Solution**: **Inbound Lead Gen (Social Selling)**

## 5. LOCAL CONTEXT (Rule 17)
*   **"Claro es molesto"**: The brand is associated with harassment. Changing this perception to "Claro helps" is a massive rebranding opportunity for the new GM.
