## 1. PAIN POINT DIAGNOSIS (The "Why Now")
*Start here. What is bleeding?*

*   **Primary Pain Point**: **Loss of Digital Dominance & App Stability**. Itaú was the digital leader, but Ueno has overtaken them in credit cards (1M+ cards) and "cool factor".
*   **Evidence**:
    *   [Ueno displaces Itaú as credit card leader](https://www.forbes.com.py/negocios/ueno-bank-lidera-mercado-tarjetas-credito-n5360)
    *   [App Store Reviews: "Errores en plenas operaciones"](https://apps.apple.com/py/app/ita%C3%BA-paraguay/id353633333)
*   **Urgency Trigger**: **Market Share Bleed**. Losing the #1 spot in credit cards to a fintech (Ueno) is a massive wake-up call for the board.

## 4. SERVICE FIT & ANGLE

*   **Proposed Solution**: **App Store Sentiment Analysis**
*   **Value Proposition**: "Analyze 10,000+ app reviews and social comments to pinpoint exactly *why* users are switching to Ueno (e.g., specific UI bugs, onboarding speed)."
*   **Deal Potential**: $120K+/year

---

## 5. LOCAL CONTEXT (Rule 17)
*   **"Itaú es status"**: Historically, having an Itaú card was a status symbol. Ueno is challenging this by making banking "cool" and accessible. Itaú needs to fight back on *experience*, not just fees.
