## 1. PAIN POINT DIAGNOSIS (The "Why Now")
*Start here. What is bleeding?*

*   **Primary Pain Point**: **The "Silent" Risk (Blind Spots)**. Unlike competitors, Farmacenter has very little negative noise online. This is suspicious. It often means complaints are happening in private WhatsApp groups (dark social) or customers are just silently switching to Punto Farma.
*   **Evidence**:
    *   [Search Analysis]: "No widespread complaints found" (2024).
    *   [Reddit]: Discussions on "Pricing" suggest price sensitivity is the silent killer.
*   **Urgency Trigger**: **Complacency**. When things look quiet, brands stop innovating. This is the perfect time for a competitor to steal market share with a "louder" digital strategy.

## 4. SERVICE FIT & ANGLE

*   **Proposed Solution**: **"Dark Social" Sentiment Audit**
*   **Value Proposition**: "You have no public complaints. That scares me. Let's analyze 'Dark Social' (WhatsApp groups, forums) to see what people *really* think about your pricing vs. Punto Farma."
*   **Deal Potential**: $60K+/year (Audit + Monitoring)

---

## 5. LOCAL CONTEXT (Rule 17)
*   **"Lo barato sale caro"**: Farmacenter positions on "Care" (Cuidamos de ti). If they are losing on price (Reddit thread), they need to know *exactly* where the price/value perception breaks.
