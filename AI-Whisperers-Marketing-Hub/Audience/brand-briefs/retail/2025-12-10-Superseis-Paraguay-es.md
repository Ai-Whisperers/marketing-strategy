## 1. PAIN POINT DIAGNOSIS (The "Why Now")
*Start here. What is bleeding?*

*   **Primary Pain Point**: **Reputation Hygiene & Service Gaps**. Despite being "Top of Mind", complaints persist about hygiene (spoiled products) and staff attitude on complaint sites.
*   **Evidence**:
    *   [TuQuejaSuma: "Lack of hygiene", "Spoiled meat"](https://tuquejasuma.com/superseis)
    *   [Market Context]: As the premium leader, any slip in quality is magnified by social media.
*   **Urgency Trigger**: **High Expectations**. Being voted "#1 Prestige" creates a vulnerability; they have further to fall if a viral "spoiled meat" video surfaces.
