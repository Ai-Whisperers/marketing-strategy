- **Overbilling Scandals**: Recurring issues with "excessive consumption" complaints (e.g., Feb 2024 spike).

## SERVICE FIT

| Service | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Comment Analyzer** | 5/5 | CRITICAL. Needs to filter "My light is out" (Urgent) from "Your service is expensive" (General). |
| **Training** | 3/5 | Focus on technical crews and call center. |

**Service Category:** Comment Analyzer Primary

---

## PAIN POINTS

1.  **Crisis Triage**: During storms/heatwaves, thousands of reports flood in. They need to separate *danger* (fallen cables) from *outages*.
2.  **Billing Disputes**: 40% of commercial complaints are about overbilling.
3.  **Channel Saturation**: Call centers collapse; users vent on Twitter/X.
4.  **Reputation Management**: Combatting the narrative of "inefficiency."
