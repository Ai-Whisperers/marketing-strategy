## Gap Selling Approach

The goal of discovery is to **quantify the GAP** between where they are and where they want to be. Use these questions to:
1. Understand their **Current State** (pain, problems, costs)
2. Envision their **Future State** (goals, dreams, outcomes)
3. Calculate the **Gap** (what solving this is worth)

> 💡 **Key**: Always get NUMBERS. Hours lost, dollars spent, opportunities missed.

- **T**imeline - When do they need to act?

## Opening Questions

Set the stage for a productive conversation:

1. "Before we dive in, what prompted you to take this call today?"

2. "What do you know about what we do, and what would be helpful to clarify?"

3. "To make sure I'm helpful, can you give me a 2-minute overview of your business?"

4. "What's the #1 thing you'd want to get out of our conversation today?"

### Deeper Pain

17. "How does [problem they mentioned] affect your business?"

18. "What does this cost you in time/money/stress?"

19. "What happens if nothing changes in the next 12 months?"

20. "What have you tried before to solve this?"

### Quantifying Pain

21. "Roughly how many hours per week do you or your team spend on [task]?"

22. "If you could get those hours back, what would you do with them?"

23. "What's the loaded cost of the person doing this work?" (salary + benefits)

29. "If we could save you $X per year, what would be a reasonable investment to achieve that?"

30. "Is budget the primary factor, or is timeline/quality more important?"

### Budget Concerns

31. "If budget is tight, would it help to start smaller and expand after seeing results?"

32. "Are there payment terms that would make this easier to approve?"

33. "If this delivered clear ROI in 90 days, would budget be a barrier?"
