## Why Follow-Up Matters (Research)

| Stat | Value | Implication |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Sales requiring 5+ follow-ups | 80% | Most people give up too early |
| Reps who stop after 1 follow-up | 44% | Huge competitive advantage to persist |
| Reps who never follow up | 48% | Half your competition disappears |
| Deals closing after 6-8 follow-ups | Most | The fortune is in the follow-up |
| Optimal gap between emails | 2-5 days | Don't follow up daily |
| Deals beyond 21 days in proposal | 70% less likely to close | Speed matters |

### Best Days for Follow-Up
| Day | Effectiveness |
|-----|---------------|
| Thursday | Best |
| Wednesday | Very good |
| Tuesday | Good |
| Monday | Moderate |
| Friday | Lowest |

## Email 1: Day 2 (Questions Check)

### Subject Lines (Choose One):
- Quick question on the proposal
- Anything I can clarify?
- Following up on [specific thing from proposal call]

### Template:

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks again for your time [day of proposal call].

Now that you've had a chance to review the proposal, I wanted to check:

1. Any questions I can answer?
2. Anything unclear about scope or pricing?
3. Anyone else who needs to see this?

Happy to hop on a quick call if easier than email.

[Your name]

P.S. I attached the proposal again in case you need to forward it.
```

## Email 2: Day 5 (Address Common Concerns)

### Subject Lines (Choose One):
- Common questions about [our approach]
- What others asked at this stage
- Before you decide...

### Template:

```
Hi [First Name],

At this stage, most people are thinking through a few things. Let me address them proactively:

**"Is this really going to work for MY situation?"**
Yes. We customize everything to your specific processes. Nothing is cookie-cutter.

**"What if we need changes after implementation?"**
60 days of support is included. We iterate until it's right.

**"What happens if I'm not happy?"**
Our guarantee: measurable results in 30 days or we keep working at no extra cost.

**"Is now really the right time?"**
The cost of waiting is ~$[X] per month based on the numbers you shared. Every month you delay is real money lost.

Anything else on your mind?

[Your name]
```

## Email 3: Day 10 (Urgency + Cost of Waiting)

### Subject Lines (Choose One):
- What waiting is costing you
- Quick math on timing
- The hidden cost of "later"

### Template:

```
Hi [First Name],

I did some quick math based on what you shared:

**Current state:** ~[X] hours/week spent on manual work
**Your cost:** ~$[X] per hour loaded
**Monthly cost of status quo:** $[X,XXX]

If we'd started last week, you'd already be saving that.

I don't say this to pressure you - just to make the cost of waiting visible.

If timing genuinely isn't right, I respect that. But if it's just inertia, consider: every month you wait is another $[X,XXX] you won't get back.

What would help you make a decision?

## Email 4: Day 14 (Final Check-In)

### Subject Lines (Choose One):
- Final thoughts on automation project
- Where do we stand?
- Closing the loop

### Template:

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to close the loop on our conversation.

Where are you at with the proposal?

**Option A:** Ready to move forward
→ Let's schedule kickoff. Just reply with your availability.

**Option B:** Need more information
→ Happy to hop on a call. What questions are open?

**Option C:** Not the right time
→ Totally understand. When should I follow up?

**Option D:** Going a different direction
→ Thanks for letting me know. Can I ask what tipped the decision?

Any of these is fine - I just want to be helpful, not pushy.

[Your name]
```

## If They Go Dark: Breakup Sequence

### Day 21 - The Honest Check-In

**Subject**: Real talk

```
Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, and I'm wondering if I misread the situation.

Sometimes "no response" means "not interested but didn't want to be rude."

If that's the case, no hard feelings - I'd rather know so I can move on.

If you ARE still interested but things got crazy, just let me know and I'll follow up in a few weeks.

Either way, thanks for your time. I hope things are going well.

[Your name]
```

### Day 30 - The Permission to Move On

**Subject**: Closing your file

```
Hi [First Name],

Since I haven't heard back, I'm going to close your file for now.

If things change down the road, feel free to reach out.

Wishing you all the best,
[Your name]

P.S. The door's always open if automation becomes a priority later.

## Key Principles

1. **Add value in every email** - Address real concerns
2. **Make the cost of inaction visible** - Use their numbers
3. **Give them easy outs** - Multiple choice responses work
4. **Don't be needy** - Confident, not desperate
5. **Know when to stop** - Respect their silence eventually

## Negotiation Tactics for Email Follow-Up

### If They Counter on Price (Via Email)

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for the counter-proposal.

Help me understand - what specifically is driving the $[X] number?
Is it budget limitations, or does it reflect the value you see?

I want to make sure we find something that works for both of us.

[Your name]
```

**Do NOT discount via email without a call. Price negotiation should happen live where you can use silence and labeling.**

### If They Say "Need to Run It By [Boss/Partner]"

```
Hi [First Name],

Totally understand - important decisions need alignment.

A few thoughts:

1. I attached a one-page summary you can share with [decision maker]
2. Happy to join a call with them to answer questions directly
3. What do you think their main concern will be?

What would be most helpful?

[Your name]
```

### If They Say "We're Going with Someone Else"

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for letting me know - I appreciate the transparency.

Before we close the loop: can I ask what tipped the decision?
Not to change your mind, just to improve how we present ourselves.

Wishing you success with the project. If things don't work out as expected, door's always open.

[Your name]
```
