## Pricing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Price on Value, Not Time**
   - Never quote hourly rates unless forced
   - Quote project outcomes instead
   - Tie price directly to ROI

2. **The 10x Rule**
   - Client should get 10x return on investment
   - $5,000 project → $50,000 in value over time
   - Makes price feel small relative to outcome

3. **Anchor High, Negotiate Smart**
   - Always present highest tier first
   - Let them negotiate down to where you wanted
   - Never give discounts without getting something back

## Current Pricing Model

We use a straightforward hourly/fixed pricing model:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CURRENT PRICING                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Service                    │ Rate                           │
├────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Web Design/Development     │ $50/hour                       │
│ AI Automation Setup        │ Fixed price (varies)           │
│ Custom Microservices       │ $80/hour                       │
│ Consulting                 │ $100/session (1 hour)          │
│ Training                   │ Course fee (varies)            │
│ Web Hosting                │ $20/month                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Competitive Positioning

### Market Rate Comparison (2025 Research)

| Competitor Type | Hourly Rate | Typical Project | Our Position |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Big 4 Consulting | $300-$600/hr | $100K-$1M+ | 10x cheaper, 10x faster |
| Mid-tier AI Consultancies | $200-$350/hr | $25K-$200K | 5x cheaper, faster |
| Boutique Agencies | $150-$250/hr | $10K-$50K | Similar quality, more specialized |
| Freelancers | $25-$100/hr | $500-$5K | Higher quality, more reliable |
| **Us** | **~$150-$200/hr equiv** | **$2.5K-$15K** | **Best value:quality ratio** |

### Value Positioning Statements

**Vs. Enterprise Consultants**:
> "Enterprise AI projects cost $100K+ and take 6-12 months. We deliver faster at transparent hourly rates."

**Vs. Freelancers**:
> "Freelancers charge $50/hour but require hours of your time to manage. Total cost is often higher than working with us, with no guarantee."

**Vs. DIY**:
> "A $50 course takes 100+ hours to complete and implement. At your rate, that's significant time cost. We do it with fast turnaround."

## Pricing Psychology Tactics

### 1. Anchoring

**Always anchor to a higher number first.**

| Technique | Example Script |
|-----------|----------------|
| High anchor | "Enterprise solutions cost $50K+. Our approach delivers similar results for $5K" |
| Show full value | "This normally takes 200 hours. At $100/hr, that's $20,000 of your time" |
| Price per outcome | "That's $5,000 to save 10 hours/week for the next 5 years" |
| Daily cost | "$5,000 over 12 months is $13.70/day" |

### 2. Value Framing

**Frame price relative to value, not cost.**

```
❌ "Our price is $5,000"
✓ "The investment is $5,000, which means ROI in 90 days"

❌ "That's our rate"
✓ "Based on your 15 hours/week at $75/hour, you're spending $58,500/year.
   Our $5,000 solution pays for itself in 7 weeks."
```

### 3. The Contrast Principle

**Show alternatives to make your price feel reasonable.**

| Their Options | Cost | Timeline | Outcome |
|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| Hire in-house | $80K+/year | 3+ months to hire | Ongoing expense |
| Enterprise consultant | $100K+ | 6-12 months | Strategy only |
| Freelancer | $5K+ | Unknown | No guarantee |
| DIY | $0-$500 + 100+ hrs | 6+ months | Low success rate |
| **Us** | **Hourly/Fixed** | **Fast turnaround** | **It will work** |

### 4. Loss Aversion

**Frame as loss prevention, not gain.**

```
❌ "You'll save 10 hours per week"
✓ "You're losing 10 hours every week to work a machine should be doing"

❌ "You could make more money"
✓ "Every month you wait, you're leaving $5,000 on the table"
```

### 5. The Decoy Effect

**Make the middle option look best.**

```
Starter: $3,000 - 1 automation
Professional: $6,000 - 4 automations ← Best value (looks 4x better)
Enterprise: $12,000 - 6 automations
```

## Negotiation Guidelines

### The Ackerman Model

Never negotiate against yourself. Use this counter-offer sequence:

| Step | % of Target | Example (Target: $5,000) |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Opening | 65% | If they offer $3,250, counter at... |
| Counter 1 | 85% | $4,250 with empathy |
| Counter 2 | 95% | $4,750 with trade-off |
| Final | 100% + non-monetary | $5,000 + quarterly check-in |

### Never Give Without Getting

| If They Want... | You Get... |
|-----------------|------------|
| Lower price | Faster decision + testimonial |
| Extended payment terms | Longer commitment |
| Extra features | Referral introduction |
| Rush delivery | Premium pricing |
| Smaller scope | Smaller price (proportional) |

### Walk-Away Points

| Situation | Minimum | Walk-Away Trigger |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Project fee | $2,500 | Below $2,500 |
| Scope | Clear deliverables | Undefined/endless scope |
| Terms | 50% upfront | 0% upfront on first project |
| Timeline | Realistic | "We need it yesterday" |

## Price Presentation Scripts

### The Confident Reveal

**Never apologize for price. State it as fact.**

```
"Based on what we've discussed, I'd recommend our Professional package.

The investment is $7,500.

That includes: implementation of 4 automations, team training,
ongoing support, and our promise: It will work. And it won't take forever.

[STOP TALKING. Count to 10. Let them respond first.]"
```

### The Value-First Reveal

```
"Let's look at the numbers first:

You're spending 15 hours/week on this, at roughly $75/hour loaded cost.
That's $58,500 per year.

Our solution typically reduces that to 1-2 hours.
Annual savings: $52,000+

The investment is $7,500 one-time.

That's a 7-week payback and $44,500 net savings in year one.

Shall I walk through exactly what's included?"
```

### The Services Presentation

```
"Let me explain our services:

**Web Design/Development - $50/hour**
Landing pages, full websites, mobile-responsive design.

**AI Automation - Fixed price (varies by scope)**
We quote based on what you need automated.

**Custom Microservices - $80/hour**
Custom software, API integrations, data processing tools.

**Consulting - $100/session (1 hour)**
Expert guidance on AI strategy, process assessment, tool recommendations.

**Web Hosting - $20/month**
Hosting on our infrastructure, API tokens included, no setup needed.

For your situation, let me recommend the right service.
What questions do you have?"
```

## Objection Handling

### "That's more than I expected"

```
"I understand - let me put it in context.

You mentioned spending 15 hours/week on this work.
At your rate, that's about $58,000 a year.

We're talking about a $7,500 investment that eliminates 90% of that.
Payback in about 7 weeks, then pure savings.

When you look at it that way, does it feel different?"
```

### "Can you do it for less?"

```
"I appreciate you asking.

Help me understand - is it a budget constraint,
or does the price not feel aligned with the value?

[If budget]: Let's look at the Starter package.
$3,500 gets you started with one automation.
Once you see ROI, we can discuss expanding.

[If value]: What would make this feel like
the right investment for you?"
```

### "Competitor X is cheaper"

```
"They might be - I don't know their pricing.

Can I ask what they're including for that price?
Support period? Guarantee? Training?

In my experience, the cheaper option often costs more
when you factor in your time, risk, and support gaps.

What's most important to you beyond price?"
```

### "I need to think about it"

```
"Of course - it's an important decision.

What specifically would help you decide?

[Wait for answer]

If we addressed [their concern], would you be ready to move forward?
```

### "It's not in the budget"

```
"I hear you. Timing matters.

Is this a 'not now' or a 'not ever' situation?

[If timing]: When does your budget cycle reset?
Let's schedule a conversation then.

[If budget size]: What budget range would work for you?
Let me see if there's a way to scope something that fits."
```

## Quick Reference Card

### Key Stats for Pricing Conversations

| Stat | Value | Use For |
|------|-------|---------|
| AI market growth | $233B → $1.7T | "The market is exploding" |
| Average automation ROI | 240% | Proving value |
| Enterprise AI cost | $100K-$1M+ | Anchoring high |
| Freelancer failure rate | 30%+ | Risk comparison |
| Course completion rate | 10-15% | DIY alternative |
| Industry success rate | 60-75% | Credibility (industry benchmark) |

### The ROI Formula

```
Annual Cost of Problem:
Hours/week × Hourly rate × 52 weeks = $X

Our Solution:
$X - (Hours remaining × Rate × 52) = Annual Savings

ROI:
(Annual Savings / Our Fee) × 100 = Y%

Payback Period:
Our Fee / (Monthly Savings) = Z months
```

### Pricing Power Phrases
