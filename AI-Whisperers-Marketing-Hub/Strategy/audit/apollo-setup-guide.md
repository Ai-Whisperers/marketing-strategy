**EMAIL 1 - Initial Outreach (Day 1)**

Subject: `Quick question about {{company}}'s customer feedback`

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} handles massive customer volume - that's a huge operational challenge.

We built a tool that helps companies like yours:
→ Detect customer complaints in real-time
→ Identify churn risks before they leave
→ Turn feedback into actionable insights

Would it make sense to show you how it works? Takes 15 minutes.

Best,
[Your Name]
Ai-Whisperers

P.S. We've helped similar companies reduce complaint response time by 40%.
```

**EMAIL 2 - Follow-up (Day 3)**

Subject: `Re: Quick question about {{company}}'s customer feedback`

```
{{first_name}},

Just following up on my last email.

I know you're busy, so here's the short version:

We analyze social media and support feedback to help you:
✓ Spot issues before they go viral
✓ Identify your happiest (and unhappiest) customers
✓ Benchmark against competitors

If this isn't relevant, no worries - just let me know and I won't follow up again.

Would a 15-min call this week work?

[Your Name]
```

**EMAIL 3 - Final Follow-up (Day 7)**

Subject: `Closing the loop`

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I'll keep this short - this is my last follow-up.

If analyzing customer feedback at scale isn't a priority right now, I totally understand.

But if it ever becomes one, here's what we offer:
→ Free custom report on {{company}}'s social sentiment
→ No commitment, just insights

Reply "REPORT" if you'd like one.

Either way, wishing you success!

[Your Name]
```

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

| Metric | Good | Great | Action if Low |
|--------|------|-------|---------------|
| **Open Rate** | 40%+ | 60%+ | Improve subject lines |
| **Reply Rate** | 5%+ | 10%+ | Improve email body |
| **Bounce Rate** | <5% | <2% | Verify emails before adding |
| **Meeting Rate** | 2%+ | 5%+ | Improve call-to-action |

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Emails going to spam?
1. Reduce daily send volume
2. Warm up your email (send/receive normal emails)
3. Avoid spam trigger words ("free", "act now", "limited time")
4. Make sure SPF/DKIM are configured

### Low open rates?
1. Test different subject lines
2. Keep subjects short (5-7 words)
3. Personalize subject with {{company}} or {{first_name}}
4. Send at optimal times (Tue-Thu, 9-11 AM)

### Low reply rates?
1. Make emails shorter
2. Focus on THEIR pain points, not your features
3. End with a clear, simple question
4. Test different CTAs

### Bounced emails?
1. Remove bounced contacts from list
2. Use Apollo's email verification before adding
3. Don't add contacts with catch-all domains
