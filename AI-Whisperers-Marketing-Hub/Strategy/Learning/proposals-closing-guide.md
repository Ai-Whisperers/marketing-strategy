## Closing Techniques

### The Psychology of Closing

| Barrier | How to Overcome |
|---------|-----------------|
| Fear of wrong decision | Guarantee, case studies, testimonials |
| Internal stakeholder approval | Help them sell internally (one-pager) |
| Budget concerns | ROI focus, payment terms |
| Timing uncertainty | Create urgency (timeline, availability) |
| Analysis paralysis | Simplify options, recommend one |

### Closing Methods

**1. Assumptive Close**
```
"Based on everything we discussed, the Professional package
at $7,500 makes sense. I have Thursday or Friday open for
kickoff - which works better for you?"
```

**2. Summary Close**
```
"So to summarize: you're spending $50K/year on manual work
that we can eliminate for a $7,500 investment. You'll see
ROI in 90 days with our guarantee. What questions do you
have before we move forward?"
```

**3. Alternative Close**
```
"Would you like to start with the Starter package to test
the waters, or go with Professional for the full solution?"
```

**4. Direct Ask**
```
"What would it take for you to say yes today?"
```

**5. Takeaway Close**
```
"I want to be honest - if you're not 100% sure, that's okay.
This only works if you're committed. Is this a 'not now' or
a 'not ever'?"
```

### Handling "I Need to Think About It"

```
"Of course - it's an important decision.

Can you help me understand what specifically you need to
think through? Is it the approach, the timeline, the
investment, or something else?

[Wait for answer]

If we can address [their concern], would you be ready
to move forward?"
```

### Handling "I Need to Talk to [Partner/Team]"

```
"Absolutely - they should be part of this decision.

Would it help if I joined that conversation to answer
any questions they might have?

Or I can prepare a one-pager summary that covers the
key points for them. Which would be more useful?"
```
