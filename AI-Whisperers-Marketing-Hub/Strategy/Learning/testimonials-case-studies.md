## Why Testimonials Matter

### The Impact on Buying Decisions

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Buyers who say testimonials impact purchasing | 72% |
| Buyers influenced by customer success stories | 90% |
| Trust testimonials as much as personal recommendations | 88% |
| Shoppers more likely to buy with social proof | 78% |

### The Trust Factor

> "72% of customers agree that positive reviews and customer testimonials directly impact how much they trust a company."

Testimonials are often the **most powerful factor** in convincing leads to become customers - more than pricing, features, or brand reputation.

## How to Ask for Testimonials

### Timing is Everything

| Moment | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Immediately after positive result | Experience is fresh |
| After completing a milestone | They're excited |
| When they express gratitude | Natural opening |
| After a successful consult | Energy is high |
| Day 30 of engagement | Results are clear |

**The Window**: Ask within 48 hours of a positive moment.

### How to Ask (Methods)

**1. Email Request** (Most Scalable)
- Direct and personal
- Can automate after milestones
- Easy for client to respond

**2. During a Call**
- More personal
- Can guide the response
- Higher response rate

**3. Automated After Action**
- Triggered by completion
- Consistent process
- Scalable

### What to Ask

**Don't ask**: "Will you write me a testimonial?"

**Do ask**: Strategic questions that yield great quotes:

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| "What was your situation before working with us?" | The problem (relatable to prospects) |
| "Did you have any hesitations before starting?" | Addresses objections |
| "What specific results have you seen?" | Proof with numbers |
| "What surprised you about the experience?" | Unexpected value |
| "What would you tell someone considering this?" | Direct recommendation |
| "How has this impacted your daily work/life?" | Emotional outcome |

### Making It Easy

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I don't know what to say" | Provide specific questions |
| "I don't have time" | Offer multiple options (quick quote, video, written) |
| "I'm not good on camera" | Suggest written or audio |
| "I need to think about it" | Send questions in advance |
| "I need approval" | Offer anonymous option |

## Templates & Scripts

### Email Request Template

```
Subject: Quick favor - 2 minutes

Hi [Name],

I hope the automation is still running smoothly!

I'm reaching out because we're updating our website and
I'd love to include your experience if you're open to it.

Would you be willing to share a brief testimonial?

It can be as simple as answering these two questions:

1. What challenge were you facing before we worked together?
2. What results have you seen since?

A few sentences is perfect. If you'd prefer, I can also
set up a quick 10-minute video call where I ask you a
few questions - super easy, nothing scripted.

Either way, no pressure at all. Just let me know!

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. If you'd rather stay anonymous, that works too.
```

### Video Testimonial Request

```
Subject: Would you share your story? (15 min max)

Hi [Name],

Your results have been incredible - [specific result].

Would you be open to doing a quick video testimonial?

Here's how it works:
- 15-minute video call with me
- I ask you 4-5 questions about your experience
- You just answer naturally (no script needed)
- We handle all the editing

The questions are easy:
1. What was your situation before?
2. Why did you choose to work with us?
3. What results have you seen?
4. What would you tell someone considering this?

If you're game, here's my calendar: [link]

Thanks for considering it!

[Your name]
```

### Testimonial Follow-Up Questions

When they give a vague testimonial, dig deeper:

| They Say | You Ask |
|----------|---------|
| "It was great" | "What specifically made it great?" |
| "Saved us time" | "Roughly how many hours per week?" |
| "Very professional" | "Can you give an example?" |
| "Highly recommend" | "What would you tell someone on the fence?" |
| "Easy to work with" | "What made the process easy?" |
