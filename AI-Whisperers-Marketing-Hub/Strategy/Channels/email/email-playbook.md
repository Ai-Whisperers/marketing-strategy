├─ Opening: Personalized hook (1-2 sentences)
├─ Problem: Identify their pain point (1-2 sentences)
├─ Solution: How we help (1-2 sentences)
├─ Proof: One quick stat or result (1 sentence)
└─ CTA: Single, clear next step (1 sentence)

```

### Best Send Times

| Wednesday | 10am, 2pm | High |
| Thursday | 10am, 2pm | High |
| Monday | 10am | Moderate |

| 7 | Day 35 | Final value | Helpful resource |

### Cold Email Templates

#### Email 1: Introduction (Day 0)

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s [specific process]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [specific observation from their website/LinkedIn].

Curious - how much time does your team spend on [manual process related to their industry]?

Most [industry] companies we talk to are losing 10-15 hours/week to tasks that AI can handle in minutes.

Would a quick 15-min chat be worth exploring? I can show you exactly what's possible.

[Your name]

P.S. Here's what we did for [similar company]: [one-line result]
```

#### Email 2: Quick Follow-up (Day 3)

```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company]'s [process]

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up - wanted to make sure my last note didn't get buried.

The reason I reached out: [one specific benefit relevant to their role].

Worth a quick conversation?

[Your name]
```

#### Email 3: Insight/Stat (Day 7)

```
Subject: 80% of AI projects fail. Here's why yours won't.

Hi [Name],

Quick stat that might surprise you:

80-85% of AI automation projects fail to reach production.

The main reasons? Unclear objectives, wrong-sized solutions, and no support after launch.

We've flipped those odds. Our clients see 60-75% success rates because we:
- Start with one specific, high-impact workflow
- Use proven solutions (not experiments)
- Include 60 days of support

If [Company] is considering automation, I'd love to share what's worked for similar [industry] companies.

15 minutes this week?

[Your name]
```

#### Email 4: Case Study (Day 12)

```
Subject: How [Similar Company] saved 15 hours/week

Hi [Name],

Thought you'd find this relevant:

[Similar Company] was drowning in [specific pain point]. Their team was spending [X hours] weekly on [manual task].

We built them a simple automation that:
- Reduced [task] from [X hours] to [Y minutes]
- Cut errors by 90%
- Paid for itself in [timeframe]

They're now using that saved time for [higher-value activity].

Sound like something [Company] could use?

[Your name]
```

#### Email 5: Different Angle (Day 18)

```
Subject: The hidden cost of "we'll automate later"

Hi [Name],

Most [job titles] I talk to know they should automate. The challenge? Finding time to actually do it.

Here's the math that usually shifts perspective:

10 hours/week × $[hourly rate] × 52 weeks = $[annual cost] in productivity you're leaving on the table.

Every week you wait, that number grows.

We handle everything - discovery, implementation, training - in 30 days or less. No disruption to your team.

Still worth exploring?

[Your name]
```

#### Email 6: Break-up (Day 25)

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back. Totally understand - timing might not be right.

I'll assume automation isn't a priority for [Company] right now and close your file.

If things change, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to chat about what's possible.

Cheers,
[Your name]

P.S. If you're just swamped and still interested, just reply "yes" and I'll check back in a month.
```

#### Email 7: Final Value (Day 35)

```
Subject: Free resource for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Last note from me - wanted to leave you with something useful regardless of whether we work together.

[Link to AI Automation Checklist/Guide]

It's a simple framework for identifying which processes in [industry] are best suited for automation.

If you ever want to explore what's possible, I'm here.

Best,
[Your name]
