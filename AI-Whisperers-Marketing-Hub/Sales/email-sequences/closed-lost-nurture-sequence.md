70% of "nos" become "yeses" within 12 months.

Circumstances change:
- Budgets get approved
- Priorities shift
- Pain gets worse
- Competitors fail them
- Champions get promoted

Your job: Stay helpful, stay visible, stay patient.

Hi [First Name],

I appreciate you taking the time to explore automation with us.

While the timing isn't right now, I want you to know a few things:

1. No hard feelings. Seriously.
2. The insights we discussed are yours to keep - use them even without us.
3. I'd love to stay in touch. Not to sell you anything - just to share useful things I come across.

Would it be okay if I checked in occasionally with resources you might find valuable?

Either way, wishing you success.

It's been 6 months since we last talked.

A lot can change in that time:

- Teams evolve
- Priorities shift
- Problems get worse (or better)

I'm reaching out to see if any of that applies to you.

If automation is still on your radar, I'd love to catch up and see what's changed.

If it's not - that's totally fine. Just let me know and I'll update my notes.

Still here if you need me.

Any of these resonating with what you're experiencing?

### Quarter 3 (Month 12)

**Subject**: One year later

```
Hi [First Name],

It's been about a year since we first connected.

I'm doing my annual review of conversations that didn't turn into projects - not to guilt-trip anyone, but to understand what I could have done better.

Mind if I ask: Looking back, was there anything that would have made working together make more sense?

Always trying to improve. Thanks for any insight.

[Your name]

## Key Principles

1. **Be genuinely helpful** - Not every email should be about you
2. **Stay patient** - The long game wins
3. **Provide value** - Share resources, insights, ideas
4. **Create touchpoints** - Stay visible without being annoying
5. **Ask good questions** - Show genuine curiosity
6. **Respect their decision** - Don't guilt-trip
7. **Make it easy to re-engage** - Clear, low-pressure CTAs

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't send every month (too much)
- Don't pitch aggressively
- Don't make them feel bad for saying no
- Don't pretend to be "just checking in" when you're selling
- Don't give up after 2-3 touches

---

## Re-Activation Signals

When they reply with interest, move them back to active pipeline:

**Trigger words to watch for:**
- "Things have changed..."
- "Budget just got approved..."
- "We tried [alternative] but..."
- "We're revisiting this now..."
- "Who should I talk to about..."

**Response:**
```
Great to hear from you! [Acknowledge what they said]

Things have probably evolved since we last talked.
Would it make sense to schedule a quick call to get caught up?

Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]
