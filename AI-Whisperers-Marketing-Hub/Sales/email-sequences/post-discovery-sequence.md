## Bonus: If No Response After Email 3

### Day 10 - Gentle Nudge

**Subject**: Did this get buried?

```
Hi [First Name],

Just floating this back to the top of your inbox.

I know things get crazy - if timing isn't right, no worries.
Just let me know either way so I can update my notes.

Still interested in exploring automation?

[Your name]
```

### Day 14 - Permission to Close

Hi [First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I wanted to check in.

Should I:

Either answer is totally fine - just helps me stay organized.

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific** - Reference actual things they said
2. **Add value** - Each email should give them something useful
3. **Create momentum** - Always have a clear next step
4. **Short and scannable** - Busy people skim
5. **Sound human** - Not templated (even though it is)
