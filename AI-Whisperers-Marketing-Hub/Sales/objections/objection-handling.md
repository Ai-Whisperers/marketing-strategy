## Chris Voss Techniques

Use these proven negotiation techniques to handle objections:

| Technique | What It Is | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Labels** | Name their emotion | "It sounds like you're concerned about..." |
| **Mirrors** | Repeat last 1-3 words | "Too expensive?" |
| **Calibrated Questions** | "How" and "What" questions | "How would you handle...?" |
| **Accusation Audit** | Preempt negatives | "You're probably thinking we're just another vendor..." |
| **Tactical Silence** | After asking, STOP TALKING | [Wait 4+ seconds] |

> 💡 **Goal**: Get them to say "That's right" - it means they feel understood.

## The Framework

### A.C.E. + Voss Response Method

1. **Acknowledge** - Label their emotion ("It sounds like...")
2. **Clarify** - Use calibrated questions ("How would...?")
3. **Explain** - Provide your response, then SILENCE

Never dismiss or argue. Objections are buying signals - they mean the prospect is engaged.

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge**: "I understand - it's a significant investment."

**Clarify**: "Can I ask what you're comparing it to?"

**Explain**: "Let me share how our clients think about ROI. If we save you 10 hours per week at $50/hour loaded cost, that's $26,000 per year in recovered time. Our engagement is typically 1/5 of that first-year value. Most clients see payback in 2-3 months."

**Alternative**: "What budget range would work for your situation? Let's see if we can scope something that fits."

---

### "We can't afford it right now"

**Acknowledge**: "Cash flow is real - I get it."

**Clarify**: "Is it a timing issue or a budget issue? Sometimes we can structure payments differently."

**Explain**: "A few options: We could start with a smaller scope and expand after you see results. We offer payment plans for projects over $X. Or, we could identify a quick win that pays for itself within 60 days - then reinvest the savings into the next phase."

---

### "We need to think about it" (Price-related)

**Acknowledge**: "Of course, it's an important decision."

**Clarify**: "Totally understand. What specifically would help you decide? Is it about the investment level, the expected results, or something else?"

**Explain**: Based on their answer, address the real concern.

---

## Timing Objections

### "We're too busy right now"

**Acknowledge**: "I hear that a lot - it's actually why most people come to us."

**Clarify**: "What's keeping you so busy? What would need to change for this to make sense timing-wise?"

**Explain**: "Here's the thing - being too busy is often a symptom of the exact problem we solve. The automation we implement CREATES capacity. Our typical client investment is 2-5 hours of your time over a few weeks. In exchange, you get 10+ hours back every week, forever. The math works even during busy periods."

---

### "Let's revisit this next quarter"

**Acknowledge**: "Happy to reconnect then."

**Clarify**: "What's happening next quarter that would make this a better time?"

**Explain**: If there's a real reason (budget cycle, project ending), respect it and set a specific follow-up. If it's a brush-off: "I want to be honest - 'next quarter' often means 'never' in my experience. If there's a real concern, I'd rather address it now. If timing genuinely isn't right, no problem - but let's be real with each other."

---

### "We need to get through [event/season] first"

**Acknowledge**: "That makes sense - focus is important."

**Clarify**: "After [event], what's your timeline looking like?"

**Explain**: "What if we did the planning and setup now, so you're ready to launch immediately after [event]? You won't have to think about it during your busy period, and you'll start seeing results the moment things slow down."

---

## Trust/Risk Objections

### "We've been burned by consultants before"

**Acknowledge**: "I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, it's common. Can I ask what happened?"

**Clarify**: Listen carefully to their story.

**Explain**: "Here's how we're different: [address their specific concern]. We also structure our engagements to reduce risk - smaller initial projects, clear milestones, and a guarantee that you'll see results or we keep working until you do."

---

### "How do we know this will actually work?"

**Acknowledge**: "Healthy skepticism - I appreciate that."

**Clarify**: "What would give you confidence it will work?"

**Explain**: "Three things: First, our case studies - [reference similar client and results]. Second, our process - we validate every step before moving forward. Third, our guarantee - if you don't see measurable results in 30 days, we keep working until you do, at no extra cost."

---

### "We don't know enough about AI/automation"

**Acknowledge**: "That's exactly why we exist - to bridge that gap."

**Clarify**: "What specifically concerns you about not knowing enough?"

**Explain**: "You don't need to become an AI expert - that's our job. What we need from you is knowledge of your business processes and goals. We translate that into automation. Our clients don't need to understand how it works, just that it works. And we train your team on everything they need to maintain it."

---

## Authority Objections

### "I need to talk to my partner/boss/board"

**Acknowledge**: "Of course - who else is involved in this decision?"

**Clarify**: "What's their main concern likely to be? And would it help if I joined that conversation to answer questions directly?"

**Explain**: "Let me prepare something you can share with them - a one-page summary of the opportunity, investment, and expected ROI. That way you're not explaining from memory. And I'm happy to do a brief call with them if that would help move things forward."

---

### "This needs to go through procurement"

**Acknowledge**: "Understood - what does that process look like?"

**Clarify**: "How long does it typically take? Is there anything I can prepare to help it move faster?"

**Explain**: Provide whatever documentation they need - W9, insurance, references, security questionnaire, etc. Ask: "Is there anything that typically stalls these processes that we should address upfront?"

---

## Competition Objections

### "We're also talking to [Competitor]"

**Acknowledge**: "Good - you should evaluate your options."

**Clarify**: "What criteria are most important to you in making this decision?"

**Explain**: "Happy to share how we compare on those criteria. A few questions that might help you evaluate: [See relevant battle card for questions to ask]"

---

### "We're going to try doing this ourselves first"

**Acknowledge**: "That's an option - tools like Zapier are accessible."

**Clarify**: "What's driving that decision - cost, learning preference, or something else?"

**Explain**: See DIY Battle Card for detailed response.

---

## Need/Urgency Objections

### "We don't have this problem"

**Acknowledge**: "Maybe not in the way others describe it."

**Clarify**: "Tell me about how you currently handle [process]. How much time does it take? Are you happy with how it works?"

**Explain**: Often they do have the problem but don't recognize it. Use discovery questions to help them see the hidden cost of their current approach.

---

### "This isn't a priority right now"

**Acknowledge**: "Makes sense - what is the priority?"

**Clarify**: "If automation could help with [their stated priority], would that change things?"

**Explain**: Often automation can support their actual priority. If not: "Fair enough. When do you think this might become a priority? Let's set a specific time to reconnect."

---

### "We've survived this long without it"

**Acknowledge**: "You have - which speaks to your resilience."

**Clarify**: "What's changed recently that prompted you to even have this conversation?"

**Explain**: "The question isn't whether you can survive without automation - clearly you can. It's what you could accomplish WITH it. Your competitors are adopting this. The efficiency gap compounds over time. The businesses thriving in 5 years will be the ones who automated early."

---

## The "No" Objections

### "We're not interested"

**Acknowledge**: "Understood."

**Clarify**: "Can I ask what led to that conclusion?"

**Explain**: If they share a reason, address it. If they don't: "No problem. Mind if I check in again in 6 months in case circumstances change?"

---

### "We've decided to go another direction"

**Acknowledge**: "Thanks for letting me know."

**Clarify**: "I appreciate the feedback - can you share what tipped the decision?"

**Explain**: Use the feedback to improve. Ask: "If things don't work out with that direction, would you be open to a conversation?"
