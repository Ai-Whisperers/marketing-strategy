## THE OPPORTUNITY

### Market Size (LATAM)
- **Total companies**: 500K+ medium-to-large businesses
- **Target addressable market**: 50K companies with active social media
- **Initial focus**: Top 5,000 companies by revenue/followers
- **Average deal size**: $500-2,000/month
- **TAM**: $25M-100M annually (LATAM only)

### Problem We Solve
Companies receive **10,000+ comments monthly** but:
- Manual analysis takes 40-50 hours/month ($2,000-3,000 cost)
- Expensive tools cost $800-2,000/month with complex setup
- Global tools don't understand LATAM (Spanish/Portuguese context)
- Negative comments escalate before anyone notices
- No way to analyze internal comments (surveys, reviews, CRM)

### Our Solution
**$497-3,997/month** for automated extraction + AI analysis + professional reports
- Setup in 1 day (vs 1-2 weeks for competitors)
- LATAM-specific (Spanish/Portuguese with local slang)
- Internal + external comment analysis
- Churn risk prediction (unique to us)
- 23-sheet Excel reports (vs basic PDF dashboards)

## THE STRATEGY: "TROJAN HORSE" FREEMIUM

### Phase 1: FREE Lead Magnet
1. Extract public comments from target company's social media
2. Analyze with AI (sentiment, churn, pain points)
3. Generate professional 23-sheet Excel report
4. Send to decision-maker with 1-page summary
5. **Cost to us**: $0.50-1.00/report
6. **Value to them**: $500-1,000 (if they hired analyst)

### Phase 2: Paid Conversion
- "We gave you insights from your PUBLIC comments for free"
- "Now imagine what you could learn from your INTERNAL comments"
- Offer B2B SaaS subscription starting at $497/month

### Why This Works
- **Zero friction**: No signup, credit card, or commitment
- **Instant value**: They see real insights from their own data
- **Proves capability**: Demonstrates AI quality before they buy
- **Creates urgency**: "Your competitors have this data too"
- **Natural upsell**: Internal comments = 10x more valuable

## CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS

### Product Gaps (Blocking sales at scale):
1. **Multi-Company Management** (CRITICAL)
   - Current: Can only track 1 account at a time
   - Needed: Manage 10-100 client accounts in one dashboard
   - Effort: 8-9 days development
   - **Impact**: Blocks agency market ($600K-1.8M ARR opportunity)

2. **Scheduled Extractions** (HIGH)
   - Current: Manual CLI execution
   - Needed: Daily/weekly automated extractions
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - **Impact**: Reduces churn (manual = friction)

3. **Simple Web Dashboard** (HIGH)
   - Current: Technical CLI only
   - Needed: Click-button interface for non-technical users
   - Effort: 3-5 days (Streamlit)
   - **Impact**: Expands addressable market by 10x

### Sales & Marketing Gaps:
1. **No case studies** (yet) - Need 3-5 customer success stories
2. **No sales team** - Need 1 AE + 1 SDR minimum
3. **No CRM** - Need Airtable/Notion to track pipeline
4. **No marketing website** - Need landing page + blog

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Customers don't see value from free reports
**Likelihood**: Low (we're giving them $500-1,000 of value)
**Mitigation**: Personalize summaries, highlight specific pain points, offer to walk them through

### Risk 2: Conversion rate lower than expected (20%)
**Likelihood**: Medium (unproven model)
**Mitigation**: A/B test messaging, improve demo script, offer 30-day money-back guarantee

### Risk 3: Multi-company management takes longer to build
**Likelihood**: Medium (8-9 days is estimate)
**Mitigation**: Start now, hire contractor if needed, launch MVP first

### Risk 4: Competition from established players
**Likelihood**: Low (we have LATAM advantage + lower price)
**Mitigation**: Move fast, build case studies, lock in customers with annual contracts

### Risk 5: Platform changes break scrapers
**Likelihood**: Medium (Instagram/Facebook change HTML frequently)
**Mitigation**: Playwright is resilient, build error detection, have fallback to manual upload
