# AI Whisperers Marketing Hub - Project Rules

> 50 guiding principles for building and operating the AI Whisperers Marketing Hub

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure & Organization (Rules 1-8)

### Rule 1: Single Source of Truth
All marketing assets, research, and campaign materials must live within the `AI-Whisperers-Marketing-Hub` directory. No scattered files across personal drives or random folders.

### Rule 2: Folder Discipline
Every file must belong to one of the five core functions: `Strategy/`, `Audience/`, `Content/`, `Sales/`, `Analytics/`. If a file doesn't fit, create a proposal for a new category before dumping it in root.

### Rule 3: Git Everything
Every change, no matter how small, gets committed. Commit messages must follow the format: `[CATEGORY] Brief description` (e.g., `[CONTENT] Add LinkedIn post draft for ANDE campaign`).

### Rule 4: No Orphan Files
Every file must be referenced in at least one README or index document. If nobody knows a file exists, it effectively doesn't exist.

### Rule 5: Date Stamp Assets
All time-sensitive content (campaigns, outreach sequences, research) must include creation date in filename or frontmatter: `YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md`.

### Rule 6: Language Suffix Convention
All content files must use language suffixes: `-es.md` for Spanish, `-en.md` for English. The Spanish version is always the primary deliverable.

### Rule 7: Archive, Don't Delete
Outdated campaigns and assets move to `_archive/` folders within their category. We learn from history; we don't erase it.

### Rule 8: Weekly Housekeeping
Every Friday: review uncommitted changes, update READMEs, archive completed campaigns, and ensure folder structure integrity.

## 🎯 Target Audience & Intelligence (Rules 9-18)

### Rule 9: No Outreach Without Research
Zero cold emails or LinkedIn messages go out until a Brand Brief exists for that prospect. Period. No exceptions.

### Rule 10: ICP Hierarchy
Prospects are tiered: Tier 1 (full Brand Brief + custom campaign), Tier 2 (abbreviated research + template adaptation), Tier 3 (template only with personalization hooks).

### Rule 11: Pain Point First
Every prospect file must lead with their specific pain point, not our solution. We diagnose before we prescribe.

### Rule 12: Evidence-Based Targeting
Claims about prospect pain points must include source links (news articles, social posts, reviews). No assumptions, only documented evidence.

### Rule 13: Vertical Specialization
Focus on one vertical at a time for deep expertise. Current priority order: Hospitality → Utilities → Enterprise (Telecom/Banking).

### Rule 14: Decision-Maker Mapping
Every Brand Brief must identify at least 3 potential decision-makers with titles, LinkedIn profiles, and any public statements about relevant topics.

### Rule 15: Competitive Intelligence
Each Brand Brief includes a section on what solutions (if any) the prospect currently uses for their pain points. Know the battlefield.

### Rule 16: Trigger Event Tracking
Monitor prospects for trigger events (leadership changes, bad PR, expansion announcements) that create urgency. Log these in prospect files immediately.

### Rule 17: Local Context Matters
Paraguay/LATAM cultural and business context must inform all targeting. What works for US companies rarely translates directly.

### Rule 18: Update or Archive
Prospect research older than 90 days must be refreshed or archived. Stale data leads to embarrassing outreach.

## ✍️ Content & Messaging (Rules 19-28)

### Rule 19: Show, Don't Tell
Every piece of content must demonstrate capability through specific examples, metrics, or case studies. "We're experts" means nothing without proof.

### Rule 20: Build in Public Authenticity
Content must reflect real work we're doing—sanitized for client confidentiality if needed, but never fabricated or exaggerated.

### Rule 21: Technical Depth with Accessible Surface
Lead with the business outcome, layer in technical sophistication for those who want it. Two audiences, one piece of content.

### Rule 22: Spanish First, English Second
All client-facing content is written in Spanish first, then adapted (not just translated) for English. Local market is priority.

### Rule 23: The 48-Hour Rule
No content publishes without a 48-hour cool-down period for review. Fresh eyes catch what tired ones miss.

### Rule 24: One CTA Per Piece
Every piece of content has exactly one call-to-action. Multiple CTAs create decision paralysis.

### Rule 25: Proof Over Promise
Replace adjectives with numbers wherever possible. Not "significant improvement" but "34% reduction in response time."

### Rule 26: Story Structure
Case studies follow: Situation → Complication → Resolution → Result. This structure is non-negotiable.

### Rule 27: Voice Consistency
Tone is: confident but not arrogant, technical but not jargon-heavy, friendly but professional. We're the smart friend who happens to be an expert.

### Rule 28: Repurposing Pipeline
Every major content piece must have a repurposing plan: long-form → LinkedIn post → email snippet → Twitter thread. One idea, multiple formats.

## 📧 Sales & Outreach (Rules 29-38)

### Rule 29: Zero Generic Outreach
If you could send the same message to 10 different prospects by changing the name, it's spam. Every message must reference something specific to that recipient.

### Rule 30: The 3-Hook Minimum
Every outreach message must contain at least 3 personalization hooks: recent news/event, specific pain point, and relevant proof point.

### Rule 31: Subject Line Specificity
Email subject lines must reference something concrete about the recipient or their company. "Quick question" and "Partnership opportunity" are banned.

### Rule 32: Respect the Sequence
Outreach follows defined sequences with specific timing. No improvising mid-campaign without documenting the deviation and rationale.

### Rule 33: Multi-Channel Coordination
LinkedIn and email outreach to the same prospect must be coordinated and complementary, not duplicative.

### Rule 34: The 5-Touch Maximum
No prospect receives more than 5 outreach attempts in a 30-day period. After that, they move to nurture or archive.

### Rule 35: Response Time SLA
All prospect responses must receive a reply within 4 business hours. Speed signals professionalism.

### Rule 36: Objection Documentation
Every objection received gets logged with the response used. This builds our objection-handling playbook.

### Rule 37: No Desperation
Never discount, over-promise, or beg in outreach. We're offering value, not asking for favors. Abundance mindset always.

### Rule 38: Track Everything
Every outreach attempt, response, and outcome is logged in the CRM/tracking system. If it's not tracked, it didn't happen.

## 🤖 Agent-Human Protocol (Rules 39-44)

### Rule 39: Agent Scope Definition
Agents execute defined tasks: research, data scraping, first drafts, file organization. Agents do not make strategic decisions or send external communications autonomously.

### Rule 40: Human Approval Gates
All external-facing content (emails, posts, proposals) require human review before deployment. No exceptions.

### Rule 41: Agent Work Tagging
All agent-generated content is tagged with `<!-- AGENT-GENERATED -->` until human-reviewed. Transparency about origin.

### Rule 42: Feedback Loops
Humans must provide structured feedback on agent outputs to improve future generations. "Fix this" is not feedback; specific corrections are.

### Rule 43: Escalation Protocol
Agents encountering edge cases or unclear instructions must flag for human decision rather than guessing. Log the uncertainty.

### Rule 44: Capability Demonstration
We use our own tools visibly. If we're not using an AI capability to run this project, we shouldn't be selling it to clients.

## 📊 Analytics & Success Metrics (Rules 45-50)

### Rule 45: Weekly Metrics Review
Every Monday: review previous week's outreach volume, response rates, and content performance. Adjust tactics based on data.

### Rule 46: Baseline Before Experimenting
Any new approach must have a documented baseline for comparison. You can't prove improvement without knowing the starting point.

### Rule 47: Quality Over Quantity
10 highly-researched, personalized outreaches beat 100 template blasts. Optimize for response rate, not send volume.

### Rule 48: Attribution Discipline
Every lead and opportunity must be traced back to its originating campaign, content piece, or touchpoint. Know what's working.

### Rule 49: Failure Analysis
Campaigns that underperform get post-mortems. We document what went wrong and extract lessons for future efforts.

### Rule 50: Monthly Strategy Recalibration
First Monday of each month: review all metrics against targets, assess market changes, and adjust strategy accordingly. Tactics serve strategy; strategy adapts to reality.
